# Creative Agents Integration Plan

This document outlines how AdCP Creative Agents (from [AdCP PR #23](https://github.com/adcontextprotocol/adcp/pull/23)) will integrate with our creative management system to provide AI-powered creative generation.

## Overview

Creative Agents provide two modes of operation that seamlessly integrate with our existing creative management workflow:

1. **Manifest Mode**: Generate static asset manifests that feed into our `creative/create` tools
2. **Code Mode**: Deploy executable creative code for dynamic, real-time creative optimization

## Integration Architecture

## Integration Points

### 1. Enhanced Creative Creation Tools

#### Current: `creative/create`

```typescript
// Current implementation
creative/create {
  creativeName: string,
  assets: ManualAsset[],
  advertiserDomains: string[]
}
```

#### Enhanced: `creative/create` with Creative Agent

```typescript
// Enhanced implementation
creative/create {
  creativeName: string,

  // Existing manual asset creation
  assets?: ManualAsset[],

  // NEW: Creative agent generation
  generateWithAgent?: {
    mode: 'manifest' | 'code',
    prompt: string,
    brandGuidelines?: BrandGuidelines,
    targetFormats?: CreativeFormat[],
    optimizationGoals?: OptimizationGoal[]
  },

  advertiserDomains: string[]
}
```

### 2. New Creative Agent Tools

Based on AdCP PR #23, we'll add these tools:

#### `creative/build_creative`

Conversational creative generation with iterative refinement.

```typescript
Parameters:
- buyerAgentId: string
- initialPrompt: string
- mode: 'manifest' | 'code'
- brandGuidelines?: object
- targetPlatforms?: string[]

Workflow:
1. User: "Build a creative for our coffee brand targeting morning commuters"
2. Agent: "I'll create a morning-focused coffee ad. What format do you prefer?"
3. User: "Banner ads for mobile and desktop"
4. Agent: "Great! Generating responsive banner set with morning imagery..."
5. Result: Manifest with optimized banner assets or dynamic code
```

#### `creative/manage_creative_library`

AI-powered creative library management and optimization.

```typescript
Parameters:
- buyerAgentId: string
- action: 'analyze' | 'optimize' | 'recommend' | 'organize'
- filters?: CreativeFilter

Capabilities:
- Auto-tag creatives based on content analysis
- Identify performance patterns across creatives
- Recommend creative variants for A/B testing
- Suggest creative retirement based on performance
- Detect brand guideline violations
```

### 3. Integration Workflow Examples

#### Workflow A: Manifest Mode Integration

```
1. User Request:
   "Create display creatives for our holiday sale"

2. Creative Agent (Manifest Mode):
   - Analyzes brand guidelines
   - Generates asset manifest:
     * Hero image: Holiday-themed banner (1200x628)
     * Headline: "Holiday Sale - 50% Off"
     * CTA: "Shop Now"
     * Logo: Brand logo overlay
     * Colors: Brand color palette

3. Our System Integration:
   - Receives manifest from creative agent
   - Converts manifest to CreateCreativeInput
   - Calls existing creative/create
   - Returns creative with generated assets

4. Result:
   ✅ Creative "Holiday Sale 2024" created with 4 AI-generated assets
   📦 Assets optimized for display advertising
   🎯 Ready for campaign assignment
```

#### Workflow B: Code Mode Integration

```
1. User Request:
   "Create a dynamic video creative that personalizes based on user location"

2. Creative Agent (Code Mode):
   - Generates executable creative code
   - Code handles real-time personalization:
     * Base video template
     * Location detection logic
     * Dynamic text overlay system
     * Weather-based content switching

3. Our System Integration:
   - Receives creative code from agent
   - Registers code with AdCP publishers
   - Creates creative record with code reference
   - Sets up real-time inference endpoints

4. Result:
   ✅ Dynamic creative deployed to AdCP network
   🌍 Personalizes for each viewer location
   📊 Real-time performance optimization
   🎯 Campaign-ready with dynamic capabilities
```

#### Workflow C: Conversational Refinement

```
1. Initial Generation:
   User: "Build a creative for our fitness app"
   Agent: *Generates fitness-themed banner*

2. Iterative Refinement:
   User: "Make it more energetic and add a video element"
   Agent: *Updates with dynamic video background*

   User: "The text is too small for mobile"
   Agent: *Adjusts typography for mobile optimization*

   User: "Perfect! Deploy this to campaign camp_123"
   Agent: *Finalizes and assigns to campaign*

3. Result:
   ✅ Custom creative generated through conversation
   📱 Mobile-optimized design
   🎬 Video background for engagement
   🎯 Automatically assigned to campaign
```
