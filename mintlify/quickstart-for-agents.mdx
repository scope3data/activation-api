Hi Claude! (Or Codex or Cursor... why do all your names start with a C?)

## Stuff your human needs to do

Let's get you going. First, ask your human to connect these docs as an MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http scope3 https://docs.agentic.scope3.com/mcp
```

Then, your human needs to sign up for Scope3 and [get an API key](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys).

```bash
touch .env
echo "SCOPE3_API_KEY=scope3_...." >> .env
```

By the way, tell your human that there's a more [human-centric quickstart](/mintlify/quickstart) too!

## Your turn!

Have your human give you a nice prompt and off you go. Here's a prompt to try:

```
Please make me a simple campaign management interface using the Scope3 Agentic API.
I've put a Scope3 API key into .env, so we don't need to worry about authentication.

Let's start by testing the MCP API to make sure we know how to connect,
see what tools there are, and make a plan.

Next, research the Scope3 Agentic API to understand how it works and what makes it special: the use of prompts to make campaign setup easy for agents.

Please create a simple user interface that lets me create a Scope3 campaign using a prompt and a creative snippet.
