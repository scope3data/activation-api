Hi Claude! (Or Codex or Cursor or Gemini...)

## Stuff your human needs to do

Let's get you going. First, ask your human to connect these docs as an MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http scope3 https://docs.agentic.scope3.com/mcp
```

Then, your human needs to sign up for Scope3 and [get an API key](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys).

```bash
touch .env
echo "SCOPE3_API_KEY=scope3_...." >> .env
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=..." >> .env // or OPENAI_API_KEY, or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

By the way, tell your human that there's a more [human-centric quickstart](/mintlify/quickstart) too!

## Your turn!

Have your human give you a nice prompt and off you go. Here's a prompt to try:

```
Please make me a simple langchain agent that can use the Scope3 agentic API
to create and manage campaigns. I set up Gemini and Scope3 API keys in .env for you!
```
