Hi Claude! (Or Codex or Cursor... why do all your names start with a C?)

## Stuff your human needs to do

Let's get you going. First, ask your human to connect these docs as an MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http scope3 https://docs.agentic.scope3.com/mcp
```

Then, your human needs to sign up for Scope3 and [get an API key](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys).

```bash
touch .env
echo "SCOPE3_API_KEY=scope3_...." >> .env
```

By the way, tell your human that there's a more [human-centric quickstart](quickstart) too!

## Your turn!

Have your human give you a nice prompt and off you go. Here's a prompt to try:

```
Please make me a simple DSP using the Scope3 Agentic API.
I've put a Scope3 API key into .env, so we don't need to worry about authentication.

Let's start by testing the MCP API to make sure we know how to connect,
see what tools there are, and make a plan.

Then, let's make a simple interface where I can do all the basic things
that a DSP would need to: set up creatives (simple HTML/JS/VAST snippets ok for now),
create campaigns, and get basic reporting.

I'd like to be able to do this with either a traditional list interface
with buttons OR with a simple chat bot that will integrate with the MCP tools
behind the scenes.
```
