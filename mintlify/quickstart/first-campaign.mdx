# Your First Campaign

This tutorial will walk you through creating your first campaign on the Scope3 Ad Platform. You'll experience our **built-in optimization** approach - where you focus on strategy and AI handles tactical execution.

<Note>
**What You'll Build**

By the end of this guide, you'll have:

- A **brand agent** (advertiser account) set up
- A **creative asset** uploaded to your shared library
- A **campaign running** with built-in optimization
- Experience with **natural language** campaign management
- Understanding of **allocation-focused** advertising
  </Note>

## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your API Key">
    [Request API access](mailto:api@scope3.com) if you haven't already. You'll
    receive your `x-scope3-api-key` via email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Your Method">
    You can follow this tutorial using:
    - **Claude Desktop MCP** (recommended for natural language)
    - **Python SDK** (for developers building integrations)
    - **cURL commands** (for API testing and exploration)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Create Your Brand Agent

Every campaign needs a brand agent (advertiser account) to contain it. Think of this as your company's advertising account.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
import scope3

# Initialize client

client = scope3.Client(api_key="your_scope3_api_key_here")

# Create your advertiser account

brand_agent = client.create_brand_agent(
name="My Awesome Company",
description="E-commerce company selling eco-friendly products"
)

print(f"Brand Agent created: {brand_agent['id']}")
brand_agent_id = brand_agent['id'] # Save this for next steps

````

```bash cURL
# Create brand agent
curl -X POST https://api.agentic.scope3.com/brand-agents \
  -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_scope3_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "My Awesome Company",
    "description": "E-commerce company selling eco-friendly products"
  }'

# Save the returned brand agent ID for next steps
````

```claude MCP in Claude Desktop
Create a brand agent called "My Awesome Company" for an e-commerce company selling eco-friendly products.
```

</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
**Brand Agent Naming**

Choose descriptive names that reflect your actual business or brand structure. If you manage multiple brands, create separate brand agents for each one (e.g., "Nike Running", "Nike Basketball").

</Tip>

## Step 2: Upload Your Creative

Upload a creative asset to your brand agent's shared library. This creative can then be used across any campaign.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Upload a video creative
creative = client.create_creative(
    brand_agent_id=brand_agent_id,
    name="Eco Products Hero Video",
    type="video",
    url="https://yourcdn.com/eco-hero-video.mp4",
    headline="Go Green, Live Better", 
    cta="Shop Now"
)

print(f"Creative uploaded: {creative['id']}")
creative_id = creative['id']

````

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.agentic.scope3.com/creatives \
  -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_scope3_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brandAgentId": "ba_your_brand_agent_id",
    "name": "Eco Products Hero Video",
    "type": "video",
    "url": "https://yourcdn.com/eco-hero-video.mp4",
    "headline": "Go Green, Live Better",
    "cta": "Shop Now"
  }'
````

```claude MCP in Claude Desktop
Upload a video creative called "Eco Products Hero Video" to my brand agent. The video URL is https://yourcdn.com/eco-hero-video.mp4 with headline "Go Green, Live Better" and CTA "Shop Now".
```

</CodeGroup>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supported Creative Types">
    - **video**: MP4, WebM, MOV formats - **image**: JPG, PNG, WebP formats -
    **native**: Text-based native ad creatives - **html5**: Interactive HTML5 ad
    units
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Creative Best Practices">
    - Use high-resolution assets (minimum 1920x1080 for video) - Keep file sizes
    under 50MB for optimal delivery - Include compelling headlines and clear
    CTAs - Test multiple creative variations for optimization
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 3: Launch Your Campaign

Now create your campaign using natural language. Our built-in optimization will handle inventory selection, targeting, and budget allocation automatically.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Create campaign with built-in optimization
campaign = client.create_campaign(
    brand_agent_id=brand_agent_id,
    name="Summer Sale 2024", 
    prompt="Reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
    budget={
        "total": 50000,
        "currency": "USD"
    },
    start_date="2024-06-01",
    end_date="2024-08-31", 
    creative_ids=[creative_id]
)

print(f"Campaign created: {campaign['id']}")
print(f"Campaign status: {campaign['status']}")

````

```bash cURL
curl -X POST https://api.agentic.scope3.com/campaigns \
  -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_scope3_api_key_here" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "brandAgentId": "ba_your_brand_agent_id",
    "name": "Summer Sale 2024",
    "prompt": "Reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
    "budget": {
      "total": 50000,
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "startDate": "2024-06-01",
    "endDate": "2024-08-31",
    "creativeIds": ["cr_your_creative_id"]
  }'
````

```claude MCP in Claude Desktop
Create a campaign called "Summer Sale 2024" for my brand agent. The campaign should reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion. Set the budget to $50,000 USD, running from June 1st to August 31st, 2024. Use the eco products video creative I just uploaded.
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>
**Built-in Optimization in Action**

When you create a campaign with built-in optimization, Scope3 automatically:

1. **Analyzes your prompt** to understand targeting goals and audience intent
2. **Selects optimal inventory mix** from premium and programmatic sources
3. **Chooses appropriate signals** (contextual, audience, first-party data)
4. **Allocates budget strategically** across selected inventory options
5. **Monitors performance** and adjusts allocation in real-time
6. **Optimizes for your goals** while maintaining brand safety standards
   </Info>

## Step 4: Monitor Performance

Your campaign is now live! Let's check how it's performing.

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
# Check campaign status and performance
campaigns = client.list_campaigns(brand_agent_id=brand_agent_id)

for campaign in campaigns['campaigns']:
print(f"Campaign: {campaign['name']}")
print(f"Status: {campaign['status']}")  
 print(f"Budget spent: ${campaign.get('spent', 0) / 100:.2f}")
print("---")

# Get detailed performance metrics (if available)

try:
performance = client.get_campaign_performance(
campaign_id=campaign['id'],
date_range="last_7_days"
)
print(f"Impressions: {performance.get('impressions', 'N/A')}")
print(f"Clicks: {performance.get('clicks', 'N/A')}")
print(f"CTR: {performance.get('ctr', 'N/A')}%")
except:
print("Performance data will be available once campaign starts delivering")

````

```bash cURL
# List campaigns to check status
curl -X GET https://api.agentic.scope3.com/campaigns?brand_agent_id=ba_your_brand_agent_id \
  -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_scope3_api_key_here"

# Get campaign performance
curl -X GET https://api.agentic.scope3.com/campaigns/camp_your_campaign_id/performance \
  -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_scope3_api_key_here"
````

```claude MCP in Claude Desktop
Show me the status and performance of my "Eco Products Launch" campaign.
```

</CodeGroup>

## Step 5: Optimize and Scale

Based on initial performance, you can easily optimize or create variations.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Campaign Optimization">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Update campaign based on performance
    updated_campaign = client.update_campaign(
        campaign_id=campaign['id'],
        prompt="""
        Expand targeting to include gift-buyers and people interested in 
        sustainable living. Increase focus on metropolitan areas where 
        initial performance is strong. Emphasize quality and environmental 
        impact messaging.
        """,
        budget={
            "total": 2000000,  # Increase to $20,000
            "currency": "USD"
        }
    )
    ```
    
    ```claude MCP in Claude Desktop
    Update my Eco Products Launch campaign to expand targeting to include gift-buyers and people interested in sustainable living. Increase the budget to $20,000 and focus more on metropolitan areas where performance is strong.
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Scale with New Campaigns">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Create a second campaign targeting different audience
    campaign_2 = client.create_campaign(
        brand_agent_id=brand_agent_id,
        name="Eco Gifts Holiday Push",
        prompt="""
        Target people shopping for sustainable gifts during holiday season.
        Focus on gift-buyers aged 30-55 with higher disposable income who 
        value environmental responsibility. Emphasize gift-giving angle 
        and premium product quality. Budget $15,000 over 4 weeks.
        """,
        budget={
            "total": 1500000,  # $15,000
            "currency": "USD" 
        },
        creative_ids=[creative_id]  # Reuse the same creative
    )
    ```
    
    ```claude MCP in Claude Desktop  
    Create a new campaign called "Eco Gifts Holiday Push" targeting people shopping for sustainable gifts during holiday season. Focus on gift-buyers aged 30-55 with higher disposable income who value environmental responsibility. Budget $15,000 over 4 weeks, and use the same eco products video.
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="A/B Test Creatives">
    <CodeGroup>
    ```python Python
    # Upload alternative creative for testing
    creative_2 = client.create_creative(
        brand_agent_id=brand_agent_id,
        name="Eco Products Lifestyle Image", 
        type="image",
        url="https://yourcdn.com/eco-lifestyle.jpg",
        headline="Sustainable Living Made Simple",
        cta="Discover More"
    )

    # Create test campaign with both creatives
    test_campaign = client.create_campaign(
        brand_agent_id=brand_agent_id,
        name="Creative Test Campaign",
        prompt="Test video vs image creative performance with eco-conscious consumers",
        budget={"total": 500000, "currency": "USD"},  # $5,000 test budget
        creative_ids=[creative_id, creative_2['id']]  # Multiple creatives
    )
    ```
