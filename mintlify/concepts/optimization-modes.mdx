Scope3 offers two primary approaches to campaign optimization, each designed for different team needs and strategic preferences.

## üéØ Built-in Optimization

**Perfect for:** Teams seeking efficiency and simplicity, agencies managing multiple clients, or campaigns where speed-to-market is critical.

### How It Works

When you create a campaign without specifying `inventoryManagement` parameters, Scope3 automatically optimizes your inventory allocation:

```javascript
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Brand Awareness Q4",
  prompt:
    "Maximize reach for our new product launch targeting tech-savvy millennials",
  budget: {
    total: 100000,
    currency: "USD",
  },
  startDate: "2024-10-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31",
  // No inventoryManagement specified = scope3_managed mode
});
```

### What Scope3 Handles Automatically

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Inventory Mix Optimization">
    - Analyzes available publisher inventory for your campaign goals - Selects
    optimal mix of premium and programmatic options - Balances reach,
    efficiency, and brand safety requirements
  </Tab>

<Tab title="Signal Selection">
  - Chooses appropriate targeting signals based on campaign prompt - Combines
  first-party data, contextual signals, and audience insights - Optimizes signal
  costs against performance goals
</Tab>

<Tab title="Budget Allocation">
  - Distributes budget across selected inventory sources - Sets appropriate
  daily caps and pacing strategies - Adjusts allocation based on early
  performance indicators
</Tab>

  <Tab title="Performance-Based Rebalancing">
    - Monitors campaign performance across all inventory sources - Automatically
    shifts budget toward higher-performing options - Maintains overall campaign
    goals while maximizing efficiency
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Example: Auto-Optimized Campaign Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Simple Campaign Creation">
    ```javascript
    const campaign = await create_campaign({
      brandAgentId: "ba_456",
      name: "Holiday Electronics Campaign",
      prompt: "Target electronics enthusiasts ages 25-45 with premium video inventory",
      budget: { total: 75000, currency: "USD" },
      startDate: "2024-11-15",
      endDate: "2024-12-24"
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic Inventory Selection">
    Scope3 automatically creates inventory options like:
    - **Premium CTV** (Hulu, Samsung TV+) with contextual targeting: $30,000
    - **YouTube Select** with electronics affinity data: $25,000  
    - **Premium display** on tech sites with 1P lookalikes: $20,000
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Dynamic Optimization">
    - **Week 1:** Equal distribution to gather performance data
    - **Week 2:** 60% to CTV (best CTR), 25% YouTube, 15% display
    - **Week 3:** Further optimization based on conversion data
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Built-in Optimization Benefits:**

‚úÖ **Faster Time-to-Market** - Launch campaigns in minutes, not hours  
‚úÖ **Expert-Level Strategy** - Leverage Scope3's optimization algorithms  
‚úÖ **Continuous Improvement** - Benefit from platform-wide learning  
‚úÖ **Reduced Complexity** - Focus on creative and messaging, not tactical details  
‚úÖ **Consistent Performance** - Proven strategies applied to your campaigns

</Note>

## üéõÔ∏è Granular Control

**Perfect for:** Teams with specific strategic requirements, experienced traders comfortable with manual optimization, or campaigns requiring custom inventory mixes.

### How It Works

Specify `user_managed` mode to take full control over inventory selection and allocation:

```javascript
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Performance Campaign Q4",
  budget: {
    total: 100000,
    currency: "USD",
  },
  inventoryManagement: {
    mode: "user_managed",
    optimizationGoal: "conversions",
    constraints: {
      maxCpm: 45,
      brandSafetyLevel: "high",
      minimumReach: 5000000,
    },
  },
});
```

### Manual Inventory Configuration

After creating a user-managed campaign, configure your specific inventory mix:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Premium CTV + First-Party Data">
    ```javascript
    await create_inventory_option({
      campaignId: "camp_123",
      name: "Premium CTV + 1P Data",
      mediaProductId: "hulu_premium_ctv",
      targeting: {
        signalType: "buyer",
        signalProvider: "customer_data_platform",
        signalConfiguration: {
          audiences: ["high_ltv_customers", "lookalike_premium"]
        }
      },
      budgetAllocation: { 
        amount: 40000,
        percentage: 40,
        dailyCap: 2000,
        pacing: "even",
        currency: "USD"
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Contextual Premium Sites">
    ```javascript
    await create_inventory_option({
      campaignId: "camp_123", 
      name: "Premium Display + Contextual",
      mediaProductId: "premium_display_network",
      targeting: {
        signalType: "scope3",
        signalConfiguration: {
          contextualKeywords: ["luxury", "premium", "high-end"],
          categories: ["automotive", "technology"]
        }
      },
      budgetAllocation: {
        amount: 35000,
        percentage: 35,
        pacing: "front_loaded",
        currency: "USD"
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Programmatic Scale">
    ```javascript
    await create_inventory_option({
      campaignId: "camp_123",
      name: "Programmatic Scale + 3P Data", 
      mediaProductId: "open_exchange_display",
      targeting: {
        signalType: "third_party",
        signalProvider: "liveramp",
        signalConfiguration: {
          segments: ["auto_intenders", "luxury_shoppers"]
        }
      },
      budgetAllocation: {
        amount: 25000,
        percentage: 25,
        dailyCap: 1500,
        pacing: "asap",
        currency: "USD"
      }
    });
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

    **Reporting Needs** | Summary | Detailed |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use Built-in Optimization When:

- ‚úÖ Launching campaigns quickly is priority
- ‚úÖ Team lacks deep programmatic expertise
- ‚úÖ Campaign goals are standard (reach, awareness, performance)
- ‚úÖ Trust in platform optimization is high
- ‚úÖ Focus should be on creative and messaging strategy

### Use Granular Control When:

- ‚úÖ Specific inventory relationships need to be maintained
- ‚úÖ Custom allocation strategies are required
- ‚úÖ Team has strong programmatic trading experience
- ‚úÖ Campaign has unique compliance or brand safety needs
- ‚úÖ Maximum control and transparency are essential

## Mode Switching

You can change optimization modes for existing campaigns:

```javascript
// Switch from auto to manual mid-campaign
await update_campaign({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  inventoryManagement: {
    mode: "user_managed",
    transitionStrategy: "preserve_performance", // Maintain current allocation as starting point
  },
});
```

<Warning>
  **Mode Switching Considerations:** - Performance data resets when switching
  modes - Allow 24-48 hours for optimization to stabilize - Consider timing
  switches during low-traffic periods
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Built-in Optimization Best Practices">
    1. **Provide Rich Context** - Detailed campaign prompts help our AI understand your goals
    2. **Set Clear Budgets** - Include total budget, currency, and date ranges
    3. **Monitor Early Performance** - Review first week results to ensure alignment
    4. **Trust the Process** - Allow 7-14 days for optimization to stabilize
    5. **Use Natural Language** - Describe goals in plain English for best results
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Granular Control Best Practices">
    1. **Start with Discovery** - Use `discover_publisher_products` to explore options
    2. **Plan Your Portfolio** - Design allocation strategy before creating options
