## What is the Scope3 Agentic Campaign API?

The Scope3 Agentic Campaign API is a revolutionary advertising platform that brings **natural language campaign management** to programmatic advertising. Instead of navigating complex UIs, you simply describe what you want in plain English, and our AI agents handle the technical implementation.
