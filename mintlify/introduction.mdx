## Quick Start: Your First Campaign

```javascript
// Step 1: Create your advertiser (brand agent)
const advertiser = await create_brand_agent({
  name: "Acme Corp",
  description: "Sustainable fashion brand",
});

// Step 2: Add a creative
const creative = await create_creative({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale Video",
  type: "video",
  url: "https://cdn.example.com/summer-sale.mp4",
});

// Step 3: Launch your campaign
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale 2024",
  prompt: "Reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
  budget: {
    total: 50000,
    currency: "USD",
  },
  startDate: "2024-06-01",
  endDate: "2024-08-31",
  creativeIds: [creative.id],
});
```

**That's it. Our built-in optimization handles the rest.**

## Our Philosophy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. People & Agents, Together">
    Your team and AI agents work side-by-side. Humans set strategy, agents execute tactics. Full transparency and control when you want it.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Allocation, Not Bidding">
  Unlike traditional DSPs with complex bidding algorithms, we focus on
  intelligent allocation - distributing your budget across the right inventory
  mix. Think portfolio management, not auction mechanics.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Works Alongside Your Stack">
    Run Scope3 in parallel with your existing platforms. Test new inventory sources, explore emerging channels, or optimize specific campaign types.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why MCP Beats Traditional Ad Tech

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Implementation Comparison">
    | Approach | Learning Curve | Implementation Time | Maintenance | Scalability |
    |----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
    | **Traditional APIs** | Weeks-months | Complex integration | High | Limited |
    | **Platform SDKs** | Days-weeks | Moderate setup | Medium | Moderate |
    | **🚀 Scope3 MCP** | **Minutes** | **Copy-paste config** | **Zero** | **Unlimited** |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Workflow Comparison">
    **Traditional DSP Workflow:**
    1. Log into complex UI → 15 minutes
    2. Navigate configuration screens → 10 minutes  
    3. Set up targeting, budgets, creatives → 20 minutes
    4. Manual performance monitoring → Ongoing
    5. Optimization changes via UI → 15 minutes each
    
    **Scope3 MCP Workflow:**
    1. *"Create a sustainable fashion campaign for millennials with $50K budget"* → **Done in 2 minutes**
    2. AI handles targeting, inventory, and optimization automatically
    3. *"How is performance? Optimize for better CTR"* → **Instant insights and changes**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Strategic Focus">
    **Traditional DSP Focus:** Bid optimization - how much to pay for each impression

    **Scope3 Focus:** Allocation optimization - where to spend your budget for maximum impact

    Think of inventory options as building blocks for your campaign portfolio:
    - Premium CTV + Scope3 signals: 30%
    - Programmatic display + 1P data: 40%
    - Contextual targeting premium sites: 30%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Choose Your Optimization Approach

### 🎯 Built-in Optimization

**Perfect for: Teams seeking efficiency and simplicity**

```javascript
// We optimize inventory allocation automatically
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Brand Awareness Q4",
  prompt: "Maximize reach for our new product launch",
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" },
  startDate: "2024-10-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31",
  // inventoryManagement defaults to scope3_managed
});
```

**What we handle automatically:**

- Inventory mix optimization
- Signal selection
- Budget allocation across publishers
- Performance-based rebalancing

### 🎛️ Granular Control

**Perfect for: Teams with specific strategies**

```javascript
// You control the inventory allocation
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Performance Campaign Q4",
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" },
  inventoryManagement: {
    mode: "user_managed",
    optimizationGoal: "conversions",
  },
});

// Configure your inventory mix
await create_inventory_option({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  name: "Premium CTV + 1P Data",
  budgetAllocation: { amount: 40000, currency: "USD" },
});
```

## For Teams Coming From Other Platforms

3. Manually set up targeting, budgets, and creative assignments
4. Monitor performance through separate dashboards
5. Make optimization changes through multiple interfaces

**Scope3 Workflow:**

1. Describe your campaign goals in natural language
2. Choose built-in optimization or configure custom allocation
3. AI agents handle technical implementation and optimization
4. Monitor and adjust through conversational queries
5. Focus on strategy while AI handles tactics
