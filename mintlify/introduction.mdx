## üå± Sustainable Advertising Technology

Welcome to Scope3 - where sustainable campaigns meet conversational simplicity.

The Scope3 Ad Platform is built for the future of advertising: **decarbonizing media through People & Agents working together**. Instead of replacing human expertise, we amplify it through AI collaboration, sustainable practices, and intelligent carbon-conscious automation.

## Quick Start: Your First Campaign

```javascript
// Step 1: Create your advertiser (brand agent)
const advertiser = await create_brand_agent({
  name: "Acme Corp",
  description: "Sustainable fashion brand"
});

// Step 2: Add a creative
const creative = await create_creative({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale Video",
  type: "video",
  url: "https://cdn.example.com/summer-sale.mp4"
});

// Step 3: Launch your campaign
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale 2024",
  prompt: "Reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
  budget: { 
    total: 50000,
    currency: "USD"
  },
  startDate: "2024-06-01",
  endDate: "2024-08-31",
  creativeIds: [creative.id]
});
```

**That's it. Our built-in optimization handles the rest.**

## Our Philosophy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. People & Agents, Together">
    Your team and AI agents work side-by-side. Humans set strategy, agents execute tactics. Full transparency and control when you want it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Allocation, Not Bidding">
    Unlike traditional DSPs with complex bidding algorithms, we focus on intelligent allocation - distributing your budget across the right inventory mix. Think portfolio management, not auction mechanics.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Works Alongside Your Stack">
    Run Scope3 in parallel with your existing platforms. Test new inventory sources, explore emerging channels, or optimize specific campaign types.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How We're Different

<Note>
**Traditional DSP Focus:** Bid optimization - how much to pay for each impression

**Scope3 Focus:** Allocation optimization - where to spend your budget for maximum impact

Think of inventory options as building blocks for your campaign portfolio:
- Premium CTV + Scope3 signals: 30%
- Programmatic display + 1P data: 40% 
- Contextual targeting premium sites: 30%
</Note>

## Choose Your Optimization Approach

### üéØ Built-in Optimization
**Perfect for: Teams seeking efficiency and simplicity**

```javascript
// We optimize inventory allocation automatically
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Brand Awareness Q4",
  prompt: "Maximize reach for our new product launch",
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" },
  startDate: "2024-10-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31"
  // inventoryManagement defaults to scope3_managed
});
```

**What we handle automatically:**
- Inventory mix optimization
- Signal selection
- Budget allocation across publishers  
- Performance-based rebalancing

### üéõÔ∏è Granular Control
**Perfect for: Teams with specific strategies**

```javascript
// You control the inventory allocation
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123", 
  name: "Performance Campaign Q4",
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" },
  inventoryManagement: {
    mode: "user_managed",
    optimizationGoal: "conversions"
  }
});

// Configure your inventory mix
await create_inventory_option({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  name: "Premium CTV + 1P Data",
  budgetAllocation: { amount: 40000, currency: "USD" }
});
```

## For Teams Coming From Other Platforms

<Tip>
**From The Trade Desk, DV360, or other DSPs?**

Scope3 doesn't replace your existing platform - it **complements** it. Use our [Migration Guide](/migration/overview) to understand how Scope3 concepts map to your current workflows and where it fits in your media strategy.

## MCP: Built for AI Collaboration

### Natural Language Campaign Management

As an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, Scope3 enables natural conversations:

```
Human: "Find me premium video inventory under $40 CPM"
AI Agent: ‚Üí discover_publisher_products({ formats: ["video"], maxCpm: 40 })
```

**Human readable results:** AI agents get structured data, humans get clear insights.

4. Monitor performance through separate dashboards
5. Make optimization changes through multiple interfaces

**Scope3 Workflow:**
1. Describe your campaign goals in natural language
2. Choose built-in optimization or configure custom allocation
3. AI agents handle technical implementation and optimization
4. Monitor and adjust through conversational queries
5. Focus on strategy while AI handles tactics
