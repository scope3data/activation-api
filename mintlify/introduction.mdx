**From idea to live campaign in 2 minutes through natural language:**

<Warning>
**üöÄ Revolutionary Campaign Management**

Transform how you run advertising campaigns:
- *"Create a $50K CTV campaign for eco-conscious millennials"*

Works with Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, and any MCP-compatible agent.
</Warning>

### ‚ö° Immediate Time Savings

| Task | Traditional DSP | Scope3 MCP | Time Saved |
|------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Campaign Setup** | 45-60 minutes | 2 minutes | **95% faster** |
| **Inventory Discovery** | Manual research | AI-powered search | **90% faster** |  
| **Performance Analysis** | Multiple dashboards | Conversational queries | **80% faster** |
| **Budget Optimization** | Manual monitoring | Continuous AI optimization | **Always active** |

<Tip>
**Real Impact:** Teams report launching campaigns in minutes instead of hours, with AI handling optimization while humans focus on strategy.
</Tip>

The Scope3 Ad Platform is built for the future of advertising: **decarbonizing media through People & Agents working together**. Instead of replacing human expertise, we amplify it through AI collaboration, sustainable practices, and intelligent carbon-conscious automation.

## Quick Start: Your First Campaign

```javascript
// Step 1: Create your advertiser (brand agent)
const advertiser = await create_brand_agent({
  name: "Acme Corp",
  description: "Sustainable fashion brand",
});

// Step 2: Add a creative
const creative = await create_creative({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale Video",
  type: "video",
  url: "https://cdn.example.com/summer-sale.mp4",
});

// Step 3: Launch your campaign
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale 2024",
  prompt: "Reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
  budget: {
    total: 50000,
    currency: "USD",
  },
  startDate: "2024-06-01",
  endDate: "2024-08-31",
  creativeIds: [creative.id],
});
```

**That's it. Our built-in optimization handles the rest.**

## Our Philosophy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. People & Agents, Together">
    Your team and AI agents work side-by-side. Humans set strategy, agents execute tactics. Full transparency and control when you want it.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Allocation, Not Bidding">
  Unlike traditional DSPs with complex bidding algorithms, we focus on
  intelligent allocation - distributing your budget across the right inventory
  mix. Think portfolio management, not auction mechanics.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Works Alongside Your Stack">
    Run Scope3 in parallel with your existing platforms. Test new inventory sources, explore emerging channels, or optimize specific campaign types.
  </Accordion>

## Why MCP Beats Traditional Ad Tech

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Implementation Comparison">
    | Approach | Learning Curve | Implementation Time | Maintenance | Scalability |
    |----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
    | **Traditional APIs** | Weeks-months | Complex integration | High | Limited |
    | **Platform SDKs** | Days-weeks | Moderate setup | Medium | Moderate |
    | **üöÄ Scope3 MCP** | **Minutes** | **Copy-paste config** | **Zero** | **Unlimited** |
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Workflow Comparison">
    **Traditional DSP Workflow:**
    1. Log into complex UI ‚Üí 15 minutes
    2. Navigate configuration screens ‚Üí 10 minutes  
    3. Set up targeting, budgets, creatives ‚Üí 20 minutes
    4. Manual performance monitoring ‚Üí Ongoing
    5. Optimization changes via UI ‚Üí 15 minutes each
    
    **Scope3 MCP Workflow:**
    1. *"Create a sustainable fashion campaign for millennials with $50K budget"* ‚Üí **Done in 2 minutes**
    2. AI handles targeting, inventory, and optimization automatically
    3. *"How is performance? Optimize for better CTR"* ‚Üí **Instant insights and changes**
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Strategic Focus">
    **Traditional DSP Focus:** Bid optimization - how much to pay for each impression

    **Scope3 Focus:** Allocation optimization - where to spend your budget for maximum impact

    Think of inventory options as building blocks for your campaign portfolio:
    - Premium CTV + Scope3 signals: 30%
    - Programmatic display + 1P data: 40%
    - Contextual targeting premium sites: 30%
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Choose Your Optimization Approach

### üéØ Built-in Optimization

**Perfect for: Teams seeking efficiency and simplicity**

```javascript
// We optimize inventory allocation automatically
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Brand Awareness Q4",
  prompt: "Maximize reach for our new product launch",
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" },
  startDate: "2024-10-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31",
  // inventoryManagement defaults to scope3_managed
});
```

**What we handle automatically:**

- Inventory mix optimization
- Signal selection
- Budget allocation across publishers
- Performance-based rebalancing

### üéõÔ∏è Granular Control

**Perfect for: Teams with specific strategies**

```javascript
// You control the inventory allocation
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Performance Campaign Q4",
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" },
  inventoryManagement: {
    mode: "user_managed",
    optimizationGoal: "conversions",
  },
});

// Configure your inventory mix
await create_inventory_option({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  name: "Premium CTV + 1P Data",
  budgetAllocation: { amount: 40000, currency: "USD" },
});
```

## For Teams Coming From Other Platforms

## What Makes This Different

<Note>
**Traditional DSP Workflow:**
1. Log into complex UI
2. Navigate through multiple configuration screens
3. Manually set up targeting, budgets, and creative assignments
4. Monitor performance through separate dashboards
5. Make optimization changes through multiple interfaces

**Scope3 Workflow:**

1. Describe your campaign goals in natural language
2. Choose built-in optimization or configure custom allocation
3. AI agents handle technical implementation and optimization
4. Monitor and adjust through conversational queries
5. Focus on strategy while AI handles tactics
