## Steps to Launch a Basic Campaign

Create your first agentic advertising campaign:
1. Connect your MCP client to the Scope3 API
2. Create a brand agent, which holds the goals and key objects for an advertiser
3. Add creatives directly or connect a [creative agent](creative agent)
4. Use a prompt to set up a campaign
5. Explore the tactics the campaign is using
6. Monitor performance

## Prerequisites

- Scope3 API key ([Get one here](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys))

<Info>
If you use Claude Code or another coding agent, try adding our [docs as an MCP server](https://methodology.scope3.com/mcp)!
</Info>

## Step 1: Authentication

Authentication depends on how you're integrating the API:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Agent-to-Agent (Python/Node.js)">
    **Python MCP Client:**
    ```python
    from mcp_client import MCPClient
    
    # TODO: Add authentication token here
    # The exact method for passing auth headers needs to be verified
    client = MCPClient(
        'https://api.agentic.scope3.com/mcp',
        headers={'x-scope3-api-key': 'your-api-key-here'}
    )
    
    # Test authentication
    result = await client.call_tool('check_auth_status')
    print(result)  # âœ… Authenticated as user@company.com
    ```
    
    **Node.js:**
    ```javascript
    import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
    import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";

    const scope3_api_key = 'scope3_...';
    const scope3_api_url = 'https://api.agentic.scope3.com/mcp';

    var transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(scope3_api_url, {
        requestInit: {
          headers: {
            Accept: "application/json, text/event-stream",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "x-adcp-auth": scope3_api_key,
          },
        },
      });

    const client = new Client(...);
    await client.connect(transport);
    
    // Test authentication
    const result = await client.callTool('check_auth_status');
    console.log(result); // âœ… Authenticated as user@company.com
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="REST">
    ```bash
    curl -H "x-scope3-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{request data}' \
         https://api.agentic.scope3.com/rest/v1/...
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create Brand Agent

Your brand agent acts as an advertiser account that owns all campaigns and assets.

Brand agents have three identifiers that you can use to reference them across all of our APIs, which saves a lookup roundtrip or the need to cache our ID somewhere:
- Internal Scope3 ID
- Your ID, which we call this the external ID. For instance, if your naming scheme is 'scope3-nike-us-aug2025-lightup-2823', you could pass that into any tool and we will map it to this agent.
- A nickname. For instance if you give the agent the nickname "Nike EMEA", you could ask "what are all the campaigns live for the Nike EMEA agent" and send "Nike EMEA" into any of our MCP tools

To get started, let's create a simple agent.

*User*:
Please create a Scope3 brand agent for Nike EMEA c/o Kinesso (which we call Nike), mapping to our internal advertiser ID abc-123. Their primary domain is nike.com.

*Agent*:
Call tool `create_brand_agent` with body:
```json
{
  "name": "Nike EMEA c/o Kinesso",
  "external_id": "abc-123",
  "nickname": "Nike",
  "advertiser_domains": ["nike.com"]
}
```

*Scope3*
`create_brand_agent` response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Brand agent created successfully"
}
```

## Step 3: Add Creatives

Creatives can be added after the campaign is set up, but let's do it now. Let's assume we're running a third-party tag for the purposes of this demo, but the platform also supports native, hosted, and custom formats too.
Again, the platform supports external IDs and nicknames if helpful.

*User*:
OK, here are my ad tags for this campaign:

Creative 1
`<html>...</html>`

Creative 2
`<html>...</html>`

*Agent*:
Call tool `create_creatives` with body:
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Creative 1",
    "snippet": "<html>...</html>",
    "snippet_type": "html"
  },
  {
    "name": "Creative 2",
    "snippet": "<html>...</html>",
    "snippet_type": "html"
  }
]
```

*Scope3*
`create_creatives` response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Two creatives created successfully"
}
```

## Step 4: Set up the campaign
The "magic" of using an agentic API is that we don't need to try to map all of the complex targeting fields across platforms because AI is very good at figuring out, for instance, that "US" and "USA" are the same thing - we don't need a complex protocol spec for handling ISO country codes.

We also don't need to try to take a well-thought-out brief and map it to an audience or contextual taxonomy. Instead, we can send our brief to signals agents - which could include an internal agent that knows about our customer data - and let the agent recommend the best audiences for this brief.

We could also manage this selection process with our own algorithm, or feed in sales data to score outcomes that would inform the Scope3 algorithm.

There is a lot more to say about how campaigns work in the agentic context, but we'll save that for later. For now, let's write a simple brief and let the Scope3 engine recommend the best tactics for our brief.

(to do - let's add scoring and optimization to this example)

*User*:
Nike is looking for high school and college volleyball players for their new line of "Super Spike" shoes - the first indoor spikes. They think the target audience skews female, but recognize that volleyball parents are often called in to make these complex shoe purchases. They want to launch in the US in Q4 with a total budget of $250,000 running on premium display inventory. We will run creative 1 and creative 2 on this campaign.

*Agent*:
Call tool `create_campaign` with data:
```json
{
  "brand_agent": "Nike",
  "prompt": "Nike is looking for...",
  "nickname": "Super Spike Q4",
  "budget": {
    "total": 250000,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "start_utc": "2025-09-01 00:00:00",
  "end_utc": "2025-12-31 23:59:59",
  "creatives": ["creative 1", "creative 2"]
}
```

*Scope3*
`create_creatives` response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Campaign created successfully"
}

## Step 5: Explore tactics
Tactics are a combination of inventory and signals that are executed in an actual media buy with a publisher. To execute a campaign, we need to:
- Find inventory that could be a fit for our campaign
- Find signals that could be a fit for our campaign
- Build a candidate list of tactics that combine inventory and signals
- Calculate how many tactics we can explore given our budget and measurement sensitivity
- Select the initial set of tactics to try
- Select a price point and daily budget for each tactic

As the campaign progresses:
- Allocate more budget to the tactics that are working
- Adjust price for tactics 

and explore more tactics to replace those that aren't

Since we didn't turn off the built-in algorithm, it will:
- Send the Nike brief and our creative formats to each publisher using the AdCP `get_products` tool and get back a list of media products (which could include publisher data or optimization)
- Send the Nike brief to any connected signals agents to see if any audience data might help find volleyball players or families
- (to do - scoring details)
- Select the initial tactics and prices based on heuristic and historical data

Let's see the tactics that the algorithm has chosen...

*User*:
What are the tactics for the Super Spike Q4 campaign?

*Agent*":
Call tool `get_campaign_tactics` with data:
```json
{
  "campaign": "Super Spike Q4"
}
```

*Scope3*:
`get_campaign_tactics` response:
```json
{
  "tactics": [
    {"id": "asci82", "publisher": "Yahoo", "product": "Yahoo Sports - youth athletes", "daily_budget": 100, "cpm", 4.50},
    {"id": "8adai", "publisher": "Raptive", "product": "Sports network", "daily_budget": 100, "cpm": 2.50},
    {"id": "as822ns", "publisher": "Weather.com", "product": "run of network", "signal_provider": "Mastercard", "signal": "Volleyball shoe buyers", "daily_budget": 100, "cpm": 5.00}
  ]
}
```

## Step 6: Monitor Performance

Once the campaign launches, we can monitor performance in a few ways, from getting log-level data pushed to a cloud bucket, using the APIs to dump aggregated data into an analytics system, or simply asking how the campaign is doing.

If we don't specify a date range, the system will assume "lifetime to date".

*User*:
How is Super Spike Q4 doing?

*Agent*:
Call tool `get_campaign_summary`:
```json
{
  "campaign": "Super Spike Q4"
}
```

*Scope3*:
`get_campaign_summary` response:
```json
{
  "dateRange": {
    "start": "2024-12-01",
    "end": "2024-12-07"
  },
  "currency": "USD",
  "summary": {
    "spend": 12450.00,
    "impressions": 2100000,
    "averageCpm": 3.93
  },
  "insights": [
    {
      "type": "top_tactics_by_spend",
      "tactics": [
        ...
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
