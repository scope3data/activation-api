## Steps to Launch a Basic Campaign

Create your first agentic advertising campaign:
1. Connect your MCP client to the Scope3 API
2. Create a brand agent, which holds the goals and key objects for an advertiser
3. Add creatives directly or connect a [creative agent](creative agent)
4. Use a prompt to set up a campaign
5. Launch and monitor performance

## Prerequisites

- Scope3 API key ([Get one here](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys))

<Info>
If you use Claude Code or another coding agent, try adding our [docs as an MCP server](https://methodology.scope3.com/mcp)!
</Info>

## Step 1: Authentication

Authentication depends on how you're integrating the API:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Agent-to-Agent (Python/Node.js)">
    **Python MCP Client:**
    ```python
    from mcp_client import MCPClient
    
    # TODO: Add authentication token here
    # The exact method for passing auth headers needs to be verified
    client = MCPClient(
        'https://api.agentic.scope3.com/mcp',
        headers={'x-scope3-api-key': 'your-api-key-here'}
    )
    
    # Test authentication
    result = await client.call_tool('check_auth_status')
    print(result)  # âœ… Authenticated as user@company.com
    ```
    
    **Node.js:**
    ```javascript
    import { Client } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js";
    import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js";

    const scope3_api_key = 'scope3_...';
    const scope3_api_url = 'https://api.agentic.scope3.com/mcp';

    var transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(scope3_api_url, {
        requestInit: {
          headers: {
            Accept: "application/json, text/event-stream",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "x-adcp-auth": scope3_api_key,
          },
        },
      });

    const client = new Client(...);
    await client.connect(transport);
    
    // Test authentication
    const result = await client.callTool('check_auth_status');
    console.log(result); // âœ… Authenticated as user@company.com
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="REST">
    ```bash
    curl -H "x-scope3-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d '{request data}' \
         https://api.agentic.scope3.com/rest/v1/...
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Create Brand Agent

Your brand agent acts as an advertiser account that owns all campaigns and assets.

Brand agents have three identifiers that you can use to reference them across all of our APIs, which saves a lookup roundtrip or the need to cache our ID somewhere:
- Internal Scope3 ID
- Your ID, which we call this the external ID. For instance, if your naming scheme is 'scope3-nike-us-aug2025-lightup-2823', you could pass that into any tool and we will map it to this agent.
- A nickname. For instance if you give the agent the nickname "Nike EMEA", you could ask "what are all the campaigns live for the Nike EMEA agent" and send "Nike EMEA" into any of our MCP tools

To get started, let's create a simple agent. This is a good example of a synchronous tool call where the response will be immediate. Some tools are asynchronous and could take some time to return - we'll cover that later!

*User*:
Please create a Scope3 brand agent for Nike EMEA c/o Kinesso (which we call Nike), mapping to our internal advertiser ID abc-123. Their primary domain is nike.com.

*Agent*:
Call tool `create_brand_agent` with body:
```json
{
  "name": "Nike EMEA c/o Kinesso",
  "external_id": "abc-123",
  "nickname": "Nike",
  "advertiser_domains": ["nike.com"]
}
```

*Scope3*
`create_brand_agent` response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Brand agent created successfully"
}
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Call">
    ```json
    POST /brand-agents
    {
      "name": "Nike",
      "description": "Athletic footwear and apparel campaigns"
    }
    ```
    **Response:**
    ```json
    {
      "id": "ba_abc123",
      "name": "Nike",
      "status": "active"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Conversational">
    ```
    User: "Create a brand agent for Nike"
    Claude: âœ… Created brand agent ba_abc123 for Nike
            Ready to add campaigns and creative assets!
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Add Creative Asset

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Call">
    ```json
    POST /creatives
    {
      "brandAgentId": "ba_abc123",

      "cta": "Shop Now"
    }

## Step 6: Set Up Real-time Alerts (Optional)

Get notified instantly when your campaign needs attention:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Setup (Recommended)">
    1. **Log into [Scope3](https://app.scope3.com)**
    2. **Go to Campaign Settings** â†’ **Notifications**  
    3. **Choose where to send alerts:**
       - Slack channel
       - Email address
       - Custom webhook URL
       
    You'll get simple alerts like:
    ```
    ðŸš¨ Budget Alert: Nike Holiday Campaign
    ðŸ’° Daily spend: $3,247 (30% over limit)
    ðŸ”§ Action: Review budget or pause campaign
    ðŸ“Š View: https://app.scope3.com/campaigns/123
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Conversational">
    ```
    User: "How do I get notified when campaigns have problems?"
    Claude: The easiest way is through your Scope3 dashboard:
            
            1. Log into app.scope3.com
            2. Go to Campaign Settings â†’ Notifications
            3. Add your Slack channel or email
            
            You'll get alerts for budget overruns, performance drops,
            and campaign status changes. Much simpler than API setup!

## Common Questions

<Accordion title="How long until I see campaign delivery?">
Campaigns typically start delivering within 2-4 hours of launch. Initial optimization begins immediately, with meaningful performance data available within 24-48 hours.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the minimum viable budget?">
While campaigns can start at $1,000, we recommend $10,000+ for campaigns where performance optimization is important. Higher budgets enable more effective machine learning.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use this with ChatGPT or Claude?">
Yes! All tools work conversationally with AI assistants. The natural language interface makes campaign management accessible to non-technical users.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I integrate with my existing analytics?">
Use the data export tools to push campaign data to your BI systems, or set up webhooks for real-time integration. We support all major analytics platforms.
