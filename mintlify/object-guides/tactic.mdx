## Overview

**Tactics** are the execution layer within campaigns - specific targeting and optimization combinations automatically generated by the platform to deliver your campaign objectives. Each tactic represents a unique combination of audience signals, brand story targeting, and publisher inventory.

<Note>
**Auto-Generated**: Tactics are created and optimized automatically by the platform's AI. You cannot manually create or edit tactics - instead, you monitor their performance and use insights to guide campaign optimization.
</Note>

## Tactic Components

### Core Elements

Every tactic is composed of several key components:

- **Signals**: Audience targeting parameters (age groups, interests, behaviors, demographics)
- **Brand Stories**: AI-generated audience profiles for precise targeting
- **Publisher Products**: Specific inventory placements and ad formats
- **Budget Allocation**: Daily spend limits and target CPMs
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics and attribution data

### Tactic Lifecycle

    D --> E[AI Optimization]
    E --> F[Budget Reallocation]
    F --> D
```

Tactics are continuously optimized based on performance data:

1. **Generation** - AI creates initial tactic combinations based on campaign objectives
2. **Launch** - Tactics begin serving ads and collecting performance data
3. **Learning** - Algorithm analyzes performance across different signals and audiences
4. **Optimization** - Budget shifts to high-performing tactics, underperformers are paused
5. **Evolution** - New tactics are generated based on learnings

## Performance Analysis

### Signal Performance Analysis

Track how different audience signals perform across tactics to understand what drives results:

```javascript
const analysis = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  analysisType: "signals",
  compareSignals: true
});

// Returns signal effectiveness rankings:
// - "age_25_34": 89% efficiency score
// - "interest_sports": 76% efficiency score  
// - "behavior_premium_shopper": 92% efficiency score
```

**Key Metrics for Signal Analysis:**
- **Effectiveness Score**: Conversion rate relative to cost
- **Reach**: Total impressions across tactics using this signal
- **Efficiency**: Cost per conversion for signal-targeted tactics
- **Recommendation**: Scale up, monitor, or reduce allocation

### Brand Story Optimization

Understand which audience approaches drive the best performance:

```javascript
const audienceAnalysis = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123", 
  analysisType: "stories",
  compareStories: true
});

// Returns audience performance breakdown:
// - "performance" audience: 15% higher CTR
// - "lifestyle" audience: 32% better completion rates
// - "value" audience: 8% lower CPM
```

**Audience Performance Indicators:**
- **Engagement Score**: Click-through and completion rates
- **Conversion Effectiveness**: How well the audience converts
- **Cost Efficiency**: CPM and CPA performance
- **Reach Potential**: Available inventory and scale

### Tactic Efficiency Analysis

Get comprehensive efficiency rankings across all tactics:

```javascript
const efficiency = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  analysisType: "efficiency"
});

// Returns ranked tactic performance with insights:
// ðŸ¥‡ Tactic #1: Sports Enthusiasts + Premium Video
//    â€¢ Efficiency: 92%
//    â€¢ CPM: $2.15 (below target)
//    â€¢ Conversions: 847
//    â€¢ Recommendation: Scale budget allocation
```

### Attribution Analysis

Understand how tactics contribute to the conversion funnel:

```javascript
const attribution = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  analysisType: "attribution"
});

// Shows conversion path effectiveness:
// ðŸ“Š Tactic Attribution Analysis
//    â€¢ First-touch heavy: Upper funnel awareness tactics
//    â€¢ Last-touch heavy: Lower funnel conversion tactics
//    â€¢ Assist-heavy: Mid-funnel consideration tactics
```

## Data Export & Integration

### Tactic-Level Data Export

Export granular tactic performance data for external analysis:

```javascript
const exportData = await exportCampaignData({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  dateRange: { 
    start: "2024-01-01", 
    end: "2024-01-31" 
  },
  datasets: ["delivery", "events", "tactics"],
  groupBy: ["date", "campaign", "tactic", "signal"],
  format: "parquet",
  compression: "gzip"
});
```

**Available Grouping Options:**
- **By Tactic**: Individual tactic performance
- **By Signal**: Performance across signal combinations
- **By Brand Story**: Audience approach effectiveness
- **By Publisher**: Inventory source performance
- **By Date**: Time-series analysis

### Real-time Monitoring

Monitor tactic performance in real-time through campaign summaries:

```javascript
const summary = await getCampaignSummary({
  campaignId: "camp_123"
});

// Returns tactic insights:
// âš¡ Top Performing Tactics
//    1. Sports + Premium Video: $1.85 CPM, 12.3% CTR
//    2. Lifestyle + Display: $2.12 CPM, 8.7% CTR
//    3. Value + Native: $1.94 CPM, 9.2% CTR
```

## Optimization Best Practices

### 1. Monitor Signal Performance
- Track which audience signals consistently perform well
- Look for signals that work across multiple campaigns
- Identify underperforming signals that may need campaign prompt adjustments

### 2. Analyze Audience Effectiveness
- Compare brand story performance within campaigns
- Note which audience approaches resonate with your brand
- Use insights to refine future campaign targeting prompts

### 3. Budget Reallocation
- Let AI handle automatic budget shifting to high performers
- Use efficiency analysis to understand why tactics succeed or fail
- Consider campaign prompt adjustments for consistently underperforming patterns

### 4. Creative Alignment
- Ensure creatives align with the brand stories being targeted
- High-performing tactics may indicate creative messaging that resonates
- Poor tactic performance could signal creative-audience misalignment

## Integration with Campaign Management

### Tactic Data in Campaign Decisions

Tactic performance directly informs campaign optimization strategies:

**High-Level Indicators:**
- **Tactic Count**: More tactics indicate broader targeting experimentation
- **Performance Distribution**: Concentration vs. spread of successful tactics  
- **Signal Diversity**: Variety of successful targeting approaches
- **Story Effectiveness**: Which brand stories drive results

**Optimization Triggers:**
- **Underperforming Tactics**: May indicate poor creative fit or oversaturation
- **Signal Concentration**: High performance in specific demographics
- **Audience Insights**: Successful narrative approaches to scale
- **Inventory Performance**: Publisher and format preferences

### Campaign-Level Actions Based on Tactic Performance

```javascript
// Example: Adjust campaign based on tactic insights
const tacticsAnalysis = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123", 
  analysisType: "optimization"
});

// If analysis shows consistent patterns, consider:
// 1. Campaign prompt refinement
// 2. Creative alignment adjustments  
// 3. Budget increases for successful patterns
// 4. New campaigns targeting discovered audiences
```
