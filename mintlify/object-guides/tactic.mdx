## The Core Equation

**Tactics = Targeting + Inventory**

Every tactic is a bet on a specific combination performing well. The platform continuously discovers, tests, and optimizes these bets using a multi-armed bandit approach.

## Campaign Modes

Two fundamentally different approaches:

### BYOT (Bring Your Own Targeting)
**You define the audience, we find the inventory**

- Start with your brand story or custom signals
- Platform discovers run-of-site inventory that reaches them
- Optimization finds the most cost-effective paths to your audience
- Example: "Find my enterprise IT buyers wherever they browse"

### Collab (Collaborative)
**Publishers package inventory + their data**

- Publishers combine their inventory with first-party data
- Pre-packaged products with built-in audience insights
- You leverage publisher expertise and relationships
- Example: "ESPN's fantasy football enthusiasts package"

## The Optimization Engine

### Multi-Armed Bandit in Action

Think of each tactic as a slot machine with unknown payouts. The platform must decide which machines to play (and how much to bet) while learning their returns.

**Phase 1: Discovery**  
Campaign starts. Platform creates 20-50 initial tactics, each getting small test budgets. Like a gambler trying every machine once.

**Phase 2: Exploitation vs Exploration**  
The eternal tension:
- **Exploit**: Pour money into the tactics showing 8+ effectiveness scores
- **Explore**: Keep testing new combinations that might beat current winners

The algorithm dynamically adjusts this balance based on:
- Campaign maturity (explore more early, exploit more late)
- Performance variance (stable = exploit, volatile = explore)
- Market changes (new inventory appearing, seasonality)

**Phase 3: Pacing Control**  
Even winning tactics need throttling:
- Prevent budget exhaustion in first hours
- Maintain presence throughout flight dates
- Adjust for audience behavior patterns
- React to real-time performance shifts

## How It Works

### Inventory Sourcing

Tactics pull inventory from the **Ad Context Protocol (AdCP)**:

- Publishers define media products with targeting capabilities
- Platform matches these to campaign requirements
- Creative formats are matched to available placements
- Quality signals ensure brand safety

### Targeting Power-Ups

Three ways to sharpen your aim:

1. **Brand Stories**: "Find people like my best customers"
2. **Custom Signals**: Your CRM segments, pixel data, lookalikes
3. **Third-Party Signals**: LiveRamp, Oracle, TransUnion (coming soon)

The platform tests how each targeting method performs across different inventory sources.

### The Effectiveness Score

**0-10 rating determines budget flow:**
- **8-10**: Winners eating most of the budget
- **5-7**: Steady performers maintaining baseline
- **2-4**: Underperformers getting minimal spend
- **0-1**: Dead tactics (auto-paused)

Score factors: conversions, CPM efficiency, viewability, audience match rate

## Control Modes

### Let the Platform Drive

```javascript
// BYOT example - your targeting, our inventory discovery
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Q4 Prospecting",
  prompt: "Find SMB decision makers interested in cloud migration",
  budget: { total: 50000, currency: "USD" }
});
// Platform creates tactics, runs multi-armed bandit optimization
```

### Take the Wheel

```javascript
// Direct control - you know exactly what you want
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Premium Sports Deal",
  manualTactics: [
    {
      inventoryId: "espn_nfl_package",
      budget: 25000,
      targeting: { segments: ["existing_customers"] }
    },
    {
      inventoryId: "foxsports_streaming", 
      budget: 15000
      // No targeting = run of network
    }
  ]
});
```

## The Bottom Line

- **Every tactic is a bet** on a targeting + inventory combination
- **BYOT vs Collab** - Bring your data or use publisher packages
- **Multi-armed bandit** continuously reallocates budget to winners
- **Exploration never stops** - Always testing for better combinations
- **You choose control level** - Full automation or manual override
