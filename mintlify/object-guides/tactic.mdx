## The Core Equation

**Tactics = Targeting + Inventory**

Every tactic is a bet on a specific combination performing well. The platform continuously discovers, tests, and optimizes these bets using a multi-armed bandit approach.

## Campaign Modes

Two fundamentally different approaches:

### BYOT (Bring Your Own Targeting)
**You define the audience, we find the inventory**

- Start with your brand story or custom signals
- Platform discovers run-of-site inventory that reaches them
- Optimization finds the most cost-effective paths to your audience
- Example: "Find my enterprise IT buyers wherever they browse"

### Collab (Collaborative)
**Publishers package inventory + their data**

- Publishers combine their inventory with first-party data
- Pre-packaged products with built-in audience insights
- You leverage publisher expertise and relationships
- Example: "ESPN's fantasy football enthusiasts package"

## The Optimization Engine

### Multi-Armed Bandit in Action

Think of each tactic as a slot machine with unknown payouts. The platform must decide which machines to play (and how much to bet) while learning their returns.

**Phase 1: Discovery**  
Campaign starts. Platform creates 20-50 initial tactics, each getting small test budgets. Like a gambler trying every machine once.

**Phase 2: Exploitation vs Exploration**  
The eternal tension:
- **Exploit**: Pour money into the tactics showing 8+ effectiveness scores
- **Explore**: Keep testing new combinations that might beat current winners

The algorithm dynamically adjusts this balance based on:
- Campaign maturity (explore more early, exploit more late)
- Performance variance (stable = exploit, volatile = explore)
- Market changes (new inventory appearing, seasonality)

**Phase 3: Pacing Control**  
Even winning tactics need throttling:
- Prevent budget exhaustion in first hours
- Maintain presence throughout flight dates
- Adjust for audience behavior patterns
- React to real-time performance shifts

### Tactic Seed Data Cooperative

When your brand agent opts into the **tactic seed data cooperative** (`tacticSeedDataCoop: true`), the platform leverages aggregated data to more effectively seed new tactics:

#### 1. Historical Pricing & Delivery Data
```
Product ABC123 delivered 10,000 impressions/day at $1.23 CPM from 9/1/25 to 9/9/25
Product DEF456 delivered 25,000 impressions/day at $2.45 CPM from 9/1/25 to 9/9/25
```

This helps seed tactics with:
- **Realistic CPM starting points** based on actual delivery costs
- **Expected inventory availability** for initial budget allocation
- **Delivery rate estimates** for new tactic pacing

#### 2. Performance Quintiles by Campaign Category
```  
Product ABC123: Top 20% of tactics for food & beverage campaigns from 9/1/25 to 9/9/25
Product DEF456: Bottom 20% of tactics for automotive campaigns from 9/1/25 to 9/9/25
```

This provides:
- **Category-specific quality rankings** to prioritize high-performing inventory
- **Avoid poor performers** by learning from aggregated campaign data
- **Better initial tactic selection** based on proven category performance

**How this improves new tactic seeding:**
- Skip inventory with consistently poor category performance
- Start with higher confidence in proven inventory sources
- Allocate initial test budgets more effectively

Without opting in, new tactics start with:
- Publisher-provided base rates only
- No category performance guidance
- Equal budget allocation across all discovered inventory

Enable via brand agent settings:
```javascript
await updateBrandAgent({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123", 
  tacticSeedDataCoop: true  // Opt into tactic seeding data cooperative
});
```

## How It Works

### Inventory Sourcing

Tactics pull inventory from the **Ad Context Protocol (AdCP)**:

- Publishers define media products with targeting capabilities
- Platform matches these to campaign requirements
- Creative formats are matched to available placements
- Quality signals ensure brand safety

### Targeting Power-Ups

Three ways to sharpen your aim:

1. **Brand Stories**: "Find people like my best customers"
2. **Custom Signals**: Your CRM segments, pixel data, lookalikes
3. **Third-Party Signals**: LiveRamp, Oracle, TransUnion (coming soon)

The platform tests how each targeting method performs across different inventory sources.

### Tactic Scoring

**Three-component scoring drives budget allocation:**

Each tactic gets a weighted score combining:
- **Quality Score** (Scope3): Media quality, viewability, IVT detection
- **Outcome Score** (You): Your normalized measurement data (ROAS, conversions, etc.)
- **Story Affinity** (Scope3): Alignment with your selected brand stories

**Budget flows to higher-scoring tactics** through multi-armed bandit optimization.

See [Scoring Guide](../optimization/scoring) for detailed explanation of weights and configuration.

## Control Modes

### Let the Platform Drive

```javascript
// BYOT example - your targeting, our inventory discovery
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Q4 Prospecting",
  prompt: "Find SMB decision makers interested in cloud migration",
  
  // Configure scoring for performance focus
  scoringWeights: {
    quality: 0.3,    // 30% media quality
    outcome: 0.7,    // 70% your conversion data
    affinity: 0.0    // 0% story alignment (B2B focus)
  },
  outcomeScoreWindowDays: 14,  // B2B longer sales cycle
  
  budget: { total: 50000, currency: "USD" }
});
// Platform creates tactics, runs multi-armed bandit optimization
```

### Take the Wheel

```javascript
// Direct control - you know exactly what you want
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Premium Sports Deal",
  manualTactics: [
    {
      inventoryId: "espn_nfl_package",
      budget: 25000,
      targeting: { segments: ["existing_customers"] }
    },
    {
      inventoryId: "foxsports_streaming", 
      budget: 15000
      // No targeting = run of network
    }
  ]
});
```
