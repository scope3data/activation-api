## Overview

**Tactics** are the execution layer within campaigns - specific targeting and optimization combinations that deliver your campaign objectives. Each tactic represents a unique combination of audience signals, brand story targeting, publisher inventory, and budget allocation.

Tactics can be managed in two ways:

<Note>
**Scope3 Algorithms (Default)**: Tactics are automatically generated and optimized by the platform's AI based on campaign objectives and performance data.
</Note>

<Note>
**Custom Algorithms**: You can manually create and manage tactics for direct control over targeting, budget allocation, and optimization strategies.
</Note>

## Tactic Components

### Core Elements

Every tactic combines several key components:

- **Publisher Product**: Specific inventory placement or ad format from a publisher
- **Targeting Strategy**: Audience parameters, demographics, and behavioral targeting
- **Signals**: Custom signals and audience segments for precise targeting
- **Brand Stories**: AI-generated audience profiles for audience definition
- **Budget Allocation**: Daily spend limits, total budget, and pacing controls
- **Pricing Strategy**: Target CPM, bid floors, and optimization goals
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time metrics and attribution data

## Tactic Management Modes

### Scope3 Algorithms (AI-Generated)

By default, tactics are automatically generated and optimized:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Campaign Created] --> B[AI Generates Tactics]
    B --> C[Tactics Launch]
    C --> D[Performance Monitoring]
    D --> E[AI Optimization]
    E --> F[Budget Reallocation]
    F --> D
```

**AI-Generated Lifecycle:**
1. **Generation** - AI creates initial tactic combinations based on campaign objectives
2. **Launch** - Tactics begin serving ads and collecting performance data
3. **Learning** - Algorithm analyzes performance across different signals and audiences
4. **Optimization** - Budget shifts to high-performing tactics, underperformers are paused
5. **Evolution** - New tactics are generated based on learnings

### Custom Algorithms (Manual Management)

For direct control, you can manually create and manage tactics:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Select Publisher Product] --> B[Configure Targeting]
    B --> C[Set Budget & Pacing]
    C --> D[Apply Signals]
    D --> E[Launch Tactic]
    E --> F[Monitor Performance]
    F --> G[Adjust Settings]
    G --> F
```

**Manual Configuration Process:**
1. **Selection** - Choose publisher products and inventory placements
2. **Configuration** - Set targeting parameters and audience segments
3. **Allocation** - Configure budget, pacing, and pricing strategy
4. **Launch** - Activate tactic and begin serving ads
5. **Optimization** - Monitor performance and adjust settings as needed

## Creating Manual Tactics
