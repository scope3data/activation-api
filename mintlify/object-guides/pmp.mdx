## Overview

**PMPs (Private Marketplaces)** are direct inventory relationships and deals with premium publishers. They provide access to high-quality inventory at preferred pricing, often with exclusive access to premium placements and first-party audience data.

<Note>
**Premium Inventory**: PMPs typically offer higher-quality inventory with better viewability, brand safety, and performance compared to open marketplace inventory.

## Managing PMPs

### Creating PMP Relationships

```javascript
const pmp = await createPMP({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  publisherName: "Premium Publisher Network",
  dealId: "pmp_premium_2024_q1", 
  dealDetails: {
    inventoryType: "premium_video",
    floorPrice: 8.50,
    currency: "USD",
    minimumSpend: 10000,
    dealType: "preferred",
    startDate: "2024-01-01",
    endDate: "2024-03-31"
  },
  targeting: {
    geoTargeting: ["US", "CA", "GB"],
    deviceTypes: ["desktop", "mobile"],
    contentCategories: ["business", "technology", "lifestyle"]
  },
  terms: {
    paymentTerms: "net_45",
    viewabilityGuarantee: 0.85,
    brandSafetyLevel: "strict",
    frequencyCapSupport: true
  }
});
```

### Listing Available PMPs

```javascript
const pmps = await listPMPs({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  status: "active" // or "pending", "expired", "all"
});

console.log(`Found ${pmps.length} active PMPs:`);
pmps.forEach(pmp => {
  console.log(`‚Ä¢ ${pmp.publisherName}: $${pmp.dealDetails.floorPrice} CPM`);
  console.log(`  Deal: ${pmp.dealId} (expires: ${pmp.dealDetails.endDate})`);
});
```

### Updating PMP Terms

  <Tab title="Traditional Updates">
    ```javascript
    // Update PMP deal terms
    const updatedPMP = await updatePMP({
      pmpId: "pmp_123",
      prompt: "Add Netflix CTV inventory and increase budget allocation by 20%",
      dealDetails: {
        floorPrice: 9.00, // Increased floor
        minimumSpend: 15000, // Higher commitment
        endDate: "2024-06-30" // Extended term
      },
      targeting: {
        // Expanded targeting
        geoTargeting: ["US", "CA", "GB", "AU"],
        ageGroups: ["25-34", "35-44", "45-54"]
      }
    });

      pmpId: "pmp_456",
      changeRequest: "increase viewability by 15% and add more premium CTV inventory"
    });
    ```

### üéØ Natural Language PMP Optimization

**Incremental optimization requests** make it easy to adjust PMP parameters without recreating deal structures:

```javascript
// Quality improvements
await updatePMP({
  pmpId: "pmp_789",
  changeRequest: "improve completion rates to 80% minimum"
});

// Inventory expansion  
await updatePMP({
  pmpId: "pmp_abc", 
  changeRequest: "add DOOH inventory and reduce open marketplace exposure"
});

// Budget adjustments
await updatePMP({
  pmpId: "pmp_def",
  changeRequest: "increase daily spend capacity by 25%"
});
```

**Common PMP optimization patterns:**
- **Inventory adjustments:** "add more CTV inventory", "focus on premium publishers"
- **Quality standards:** "improve viewability to 90%", "stricter brand safety filtering" 
- **Budget changes:** "increase spend by 30%", "reduce floor prices by $2"
- **Performance targets:** "improve completion rates", "target lower CPMs"

## DSP Integration

### DSP Seat Management

PMPs often require DSP seat IDs for proper integration:

```javascript
// Get available DSP seats for PMP setup
const dspSeats = await getDSPSeats({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  dspName: "trade_desk" // or "dv360", "amazon_dsp", etc.
});

console.log("Available DSP seats:");
dspSeats.forEach(seat => {
  console.log(`‚Ä¢ ${seat.name}: ${seat.seatId}`);
});
```

### PMP Activation

```javascript
// Activate PMP with DSP seat configuration
const activatedPMP = await updatePMP({
  pmpId: "pmp_456",
  dspIntegration: {
    dspName: "trade_desk",
    seatId: "seat_789",
    dealActivation: {
      bidStrategy: "fixed_price",
      budgetAllocation: 25000,
      startDate: "2024-01-15"
    }
  },
  status: "active"
});
```

  timeframe: "30d",
  metrics: [
    "delivery_rate",
    "average_cpm", 
    "viewability_rate",
    "brand_safety_score",
    "conversion_rate"
  ]
});

if (pmpPerformance.viewability_rate > 0.90) {
  // High-performing PMP - increase allocation
  await adjustPMPBudget({
    pmpId: "pmp_123",
    newBudgetAllocation: 35000
  });
}
```

## Integration with Campaign Strategy

  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Premium Brand Campaign",
  inventoryStrategy: {
    preferredPMPs: ["pmp_123", "pmp_456"],
    fallbackToOpenMarket: true,
    pmpBudgetAllocation: 0.70 // 70% of budget to PMPs
  },
  qualityThresholds: {
    minimumViewability: 0.80,
    brandSafetyLevel: "strict",
    premiumInventoryPreference: true
  }
});
```

### PMP vs Open Market Strategy

- **Monitor Performance**: Regular review of PMP vs. open market performance
- **Budget Allocation**: Balance PMP commitments with campaign flexibility
- **Seasonal Planning**: Account for seasonal inventory pricing and availability

### Technical Integration

- **DSP Setup**: Ensure proper DSP seat configuration and deal activation
