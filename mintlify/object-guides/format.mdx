## Overview

**Creative Formats** are technical specifications that dictate how creative assets must be structured for delivery. These specifications are defined by:

1. **Publishers** - Yahoo, Reddit, Meta, Google, Amazon, etc.
2. **Industry Standards Bodies** - IAB Tech Lab and other organizations

Think of creative formats as the "contract" between your creative content and where it will be displayed.

<Warning>
**Important**: Scope3 uses **AdCP (Ad Context Protocol)** for all creative format definitions. AdCP provides standardized format specifications that work across publishers and platforms.
</Warning>

## AdCP Creative Formats

### How We Use AdCP

Scope3 leverages the Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) for all creative format management:

<Note>
**Why AdCP?** AdCP provides a unified standard for creative formats across all major publishers and platforms, eliminating the need to manage platform-specific variations manually.
</Note>

## How Creative Formats Work in Scope3

### Creating Creatives for Specific Formats

When creating a creative, you specify which AdCP format it should target:

```javascript
// Create a creative for a specific format
const creative = await createCreative({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Product Video - CTV",
  formatId: "adcp_ctv_standard_30s",  // Target specific AdCP format
  url: "https://cdn.brand.com/video-30s.mp4",
  headline: "Discover Our Product",
  cta: "Learn More"
});

console.log(creative.format);
// Output: "adcp_ctv_standard_30s"
```

### Format Validation

Scope3 validates that your creative assets meet the requirements of the specified format:

1. **Format Selection**: You choose the target AdCP format
2. **Asset Validation**: We verify your assets meet format specifications
3. **Compliance Check**: Ensure all required elements are present
4. **Delivery Ready**: Creative is certified for the specified format

### Key Benefits

- **Format Precision**: Create exactly what publishers need
- **Validation**: Know immediately if assets meet requirements
- **Standards-Based**: AdCP ensures industry-wide compatibility
- **Clear Intent**: Explicit format targeting prevents delivery issues

## Common Questions
