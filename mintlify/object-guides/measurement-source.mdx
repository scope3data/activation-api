## Overview

**Measurement Sources** are analytics integrations and data connections that provide campaign performance tracking, attribution data, and conversion measurement. They enable comprehensive campaign analysis by connecting first-party data, third-party analytics, and conversion tracking systems.

<Note>
**Data Integration**: Measurement sources connect your existing analytics tools and data sources to provide unified campaign performance reporting.

        currencyParameter: "currency"
      },
      {
        eventName: "Lead", 
        customParameters: ["lead_type", "lead_source"]
      }
    ],
    deduplication: {
      enabled: true,
      eventIdParameter: "event_id",
      windowHours: 24
    }
  }
});
```

### MMM Platform Integration

```javascript
const mmmSource = await addMeasurementSource({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Marketing Mix Model",
  type: "mmm",
  configuration: {
    provider: "custom_mmm_platform",
    modelId: "mmm_model_2024",

      "marketing_contribution",
      "channel_efficiency",
      "optimal_budget_allocation"
    ]
  }
});
```

## Managing Measurement Sources

### List Active Sources

```javascript
const sources = await listMeasurementSources({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  type: "all" // or "analytics", "brand_study", "conversion_api", "mmm"
});

console.log(`Found ${sources.length} measurement sources:`);
sources.forEach(source => {
  console.log(`• ${source.name} (${source.type})`);
  console.log(`  Status: ${source.status}`);
  console.log(`  Last Updated: ${source.lastSync}`);
});
```

### Data Validation and Health Checks

```javascript
// Check measurement source data quality
const dataHealth = await validateMeasurementSource({
  sourceId: "ms_123",
  healthChecks: [
    "data_freshness",
    "conversion_tracking",
    "attribution_accuracy",
    "data_completeness"
  ]
});

if (dataHealth.status === "healthy") {
  console.log("✅ Measurement source is functioning properly");
} else {
  console.log("⚠️  Issues detected:", dataHealth.issues);
}
```

## Data Flow and Attribution

### Multi-Source Attribution

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Campaign Serves Ads] --> B[User Interactions]
    B --> C[Analytics Tracking]
    B --> D[Conversion APIs]
    B --> E[Brand Studies]
    C --> F[Attribution Engine]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Unified Reporting]
    G --> H[Optimization Insights]
```

### Data Consolidation Process

1. **Data Collection**: Each source collects performance and conversion data
2. **Normalization**: Data is standardized across different source formats
3. **Deduplication**: Prevent double-counting across multiple sources
4. **Attribution**: Apply attribution models to assign conversion credit
5. **Aggregation**: Combine data for unified campaign reporting

## Performance Measurement

### Key Metrics by Source Type

**Analytics Sources**
- Conversion volume and conversion rate
- Revenue attribution and ROAS measurement
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV)
- Path-to-conversion analysis and touchpoint attribution

**Brand Study Sources**
- Brand awareness lift and statistical significance
- Purchase intent improvement and consideration metrics
- Ad recall and brand favorability changes
- Control vs. test group performance comparison

**Conversion API Sources**
- Event tracking accuracy and data completeness
- Cross-device attribution and user matching rates
- Conversion optimization performance and bid efficiency
- Data freshness and real-time tracking capability

### Data Quality Monitoring

```javascript
// Monitor measurement source performance
const sourceMetrics = await analyzeMeasurementSource({
  sourceId: "ms_123",
  timeframe: "7d",
  analysis: [
    "data_latency",
    "conversion_accuracy", 
    "attribution_consistency",
    "tracking_coverage"
  ]
});

// Alert on data quality issues
if (sourceMetrics.data_latency > 6) { // hours
  console.log("⚠️  Data latency exceeding threshold");
}
```

## Integration Best Practices

### Data Privacy and Compliance

- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure proper consent handling and data processing agreements
- **CCPA Requirements**: Implement proper data opt-out mechanisms and user rights
- **First-Party Data**: Prioritize first-party data sources for measurement accuracy
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for campaign measurement

### Technical Implementation

- **Server-Side Tracking**: Use server-side APIs for improved accuracy and privacy
- **Event Deduplication**: Implement proper event ID systems to prevent double-counting
- **Error Handling**: Build robust error handling and retry mechanisms
- **Data Validation**: Validate data quality and completeness regularly

### Measurement Strategy

- **Multi-Source Validation**: Use multiple sources to validate campaign performance
- **Attribution Modeling**: Choose appropriate attribution models for business goals
- **Incrementality Testing**: Regular lift studies to validate attributed conversions
- **Baseline Measurement**: Establish pre-campaign baselines for accurate lift measurement
