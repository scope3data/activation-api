## Overview

**Creatives** are the actual ad content that users see - the videos, images, text, and interactive experiences that bring your brand message to life. In the Scope3 platform, creatives are created and stored at the **Brand Agent** level (the advertiser's account), then referenced by multiple campaigns as needed.

<Warning>
**Important Architecture**: Creatives belong to Brand Agents, NOT to campaigns. You first create creatives in the brand agent's library, then campaigns reference those creatives. This enables reuse across multiple campaigns.
</Warning>

## Creative Architecture

### How Creatives Work

Creatives implement specific formats using assets:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Assets] --> B[Creative]
    C[Format] --> B
    B --> D[Campaign Delivery]
    
    A1[Video File] --> A
    A2[Image File] --> A
    A3[Text/Headlines] --> A
    
    C1[AdCP Format Spec] --> C
```

**Key Concepts**:
- **Assets** - The actual media files (images, videos, text) you provide
- **Format** - The AdCP specification that defines requirements
- **Creative** - Implements a specific format using your assets
- **Delivery** - Creative is delivered to campaigns that need that format

### Asset Requirements

<Warning>
**Important**: All creative assets must be uploaded to a public CDN where we can access them. You provide URLs to your assets when creating creatives.
</Warning>

```json
{
  "creative": {
    "url": "https://cdn.yourbrand.com/video.mp4",
    "headline": "Your Product",
    "cta": "Learn More"
  }
}
```

</Card>

### 3. Creative Assignment Pattern

Creatives follow a **create-once, use-many** pattern:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Brand Agent] --> B[Creative Library]
    B --> C[Creative 1]
    B --> D[Creative 2]
    B --> E[Creative 3]
    
    C --> F[Campaign A]
    C --> G[Campaign B]
    D --> F
    D --> H[Campaign C]
    E --> G
    E --> H
```

**Benefits**:
- **Efficiency**: Upload once, use everywhere
- **Consistency**: Same creative across campaigns
- **Performance Tracking**: See which creatives work best
- **A/B Testing**: Easy creative rotation

## Creative Lifecycle

### Creative Creation Approaches

Choose from three approaches to create creatives:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="3rd Party Ad Server">
    **Use existing ad server tags (e.g., Google CM360, Flashtalking)**
    
    We take your ad server code and wrap it in a creative - it's a single step:
    
    ```javascript
    const creative = await createCreative({
      brandAgentId: "ba_123",
      name: "Campaign Creative",
      formatId: "adcp_display_300x250",
      adServerTag: "https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/..."
    });
    ```
    
    **Best for**: Teams with existing ad server relationships
    **How it works**: Your ad server tag is passed through directly to publishers
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Native">
    **Provide assets for publisher assembly**
    
    We send your assets onward to the publisher for assembly:
    
    ```javascript
    const creative = await createCreative({
      brandAgentId: "ba_123",
      name: "Hero Video",
      formatId: "adcp_ctv_standard_30s",
      url: "https://cdn.yourbrand.com/video-30s.mp4",
      headline: "Your Product",
      cta: "Learn More"
    });
    ```
    
    **Best for**: Direct control over asset hosting and delivery
    **How it works**: Assets are delivered to publishers who handle final assembly
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Creative Agent">
    **Use AI-powered creative generation**
    
    Provide a brief and optional assets/audiences to the agent:
    
    ```javascript
    const creative = await generateCreative({
      brandAgentId: "ba_123",
      brief: "Create a 30s video showcasing our new product",
      formatId: "adcp_ctv_standard_30s",
      assets: ["logo.png", "product-shots.mp4"],  // Optional
      audienceIds: ["aud_tech_enthusiasts"]       // Optional brand stories
    });
    ```
    
    **Best for**: Rapid creative generation and testing
    **How it works**: AI generates creative based on brief, brand assets, and audience insights

### Campaign Assignment

Creatives are assigned to campaigns during creation or via updates:

```javascript
// Option 1: Assign during campaign creation
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123",
  name: "Summer Sale Campaign",
  creativeIds: ["cr_video_456", "cr_display_789"], // Assign creatives
  budget: { total: 50000, currency: "USD" }
});

// Option 2: Update existing campaign
const updated = await updateCampaign({
  campaignId: "camp_abc123",
  creativeIds: ["cr_video_456", "cr_native_012"] // Replace creatives
});
```

const videoCreative = await createCreative({
  brandAgentId: "ba_brand_123",
  name: "Hero Video - 30s",
  type: "video",
  url: "https://cdn.brand.com/hero-30s.mp4"
});

// 2. Create display creative for retargeting
const displayCreative = await createCreative({
  brandAgentId: "ba_brand_123",
  name: "Product Banner Set",
  type: "image",
  url: "https://cdn.brand.com/banner-300x250.jpg"
});

// 3. Create native creative for content sites
const nativeCreative = await createCreative({
  brandAgentId: "ba_brand_123",
  name: "Sponsored Story",
  type: "native",
  headline: "Discover Our Latest Innovation",
  body: "Learn how our products can transform...",
  url: "https://cdn.brand.com/native-hero.jpg"
});

// 4. Launch campaign with all creatives
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_brand_123",
  name: "Q4 Integrated Campaign",
  creativeIds: [
    videoCreative.id,
    displayCreative.id,
    nativeCreative.id
  ],
  budget: { total: 100000, currency: "USD" }
});
```

### Creative Performance Analysis

```javascript
// Get campaign summary with creative breakdown
const summary = await getCampaignSummary({
  campaignId: "camp_abc123",
  includeCreativePerformance: true
});

// Analyze which creatives drive performance
summary.creativePerformance.forEach(creative => {
  console.log(`${creative.name}:
    - Impressions: ${creative.impressions}
    - CTR: ${creative.ctr}%
    - Conversions: ${creative.conversions}
    - Efficiency Score: ${creative.efficiencyScore}/100
  `);
});

// Optimize based on performance
const topPerformers = summary.creativePerformance
  .filter(c => c.efficiencyScore > 80)
  .map(c => c.id);

await updateCampaign({
  campaignId: "camp_abc123",
  creativeIds: topPerformers // Focus on winners
});
```

## Troubleshooting
