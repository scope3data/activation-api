## Overview

**Signals** are data points that inform campaign targeting and optimization decisions. The Scope3 platform uses two distinct types of signals to create effective advertising tactics and improve campaign performance.

## Two Types of Signals

### 1. Third-Party Signals

**External data providers** - additional cost applies:

- **Weather Data**: Current weather conditions for user location
- **Audience Segments**: Demographics and behavioral data from data providers
- **Economic Indicators**: Local market conditions, spending patterns
- **Event Data**: Local events, sports schedules, cultural activities
- **Contextual Data**: Real-time content analysis and sentiment

<Info>
Third-party signals are **coming soon**. Contact support@scope3.com for early access and pricing information.
</Info>

### 2. Custom Signals (First-Party Data)

**Your own data** - no additional cost:

- **CRM Segments**: Customer loyalty tiers, purchase history, lifetime value
- **Behavioral Data**: Website interactions, app usage patterns
- **Geographic Data**: Store locations, service areas, market territories  
- **Custom Attributes**: Any business-specific targeting parameters

Upload and manage your first-party data through the [Custom Signals Platform](../integrations/custom-signals-platform).

## How Signal RAG Works

**Signal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is how the platform combines multiple signal types to create optimized targeting tactics:

### The Process

1. **Signal Collection**: The platform gathers all available signals for each impression opportunity
   - Custom signals (your first-party data)
   - Third-party signals (when available)
   - Built-in targeting (media quality, viewability predictions)

2. **Context Retrieval**: Relevant signals are retrieved based on campaign objectives and targeting criteria

3. **Tactic Generation**: AI combines signals to create optimized targeting combinations
   - High-quality inventory + loyal customers + favorable weather
   - Premium content + high completion rates + recent purchasers

4. **Performance Learning**: Results feed back into the system to improve future signal combinations

### Developer Benefits

For technical teams, Signal RAG provides:
- **Explainable AI**: Understand which signals drove targeting decisions
- **Performance Attribution**: Track signal effectiveness across tactics
- **Custom Integration**: Add your own signals to the optimization process
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Signal combinations adjust based on performance data

## Using Signals in Campaigns

Signals work automatically in campaign optimization, but you can influence their usage:

### In Campaign Prompts

```javascript
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Premium Quality Campaign",
  prompt: "Target high_value_customers on premium inventory with strong completion rates",
  budget: { total: 50000, currency: "USD" }
});

// The platform automatically selects relevant signals:
// - Custom: high_value_customers (your first-party data)
// - Built-in: premium_inventory, high_completion_rate targeting
// - Creates optimized tactics combining these signals
```

### Performance Analysis

Monitor signal effectiveness through tactic analysis:

```javascript
const signalAnalysis = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  analysisType: "signals"
});

// Returns effectiveness scores for different signal combinations
// helping you understand what drives performance
```

## Signal Performance Metrics

**Effectiveness Score**: Primary metric combining conversion rate and cost efficiency
- **High Score (&gt;8.0)**: Scale up budget allocation
- **Medium Score (5.0-8.0)**: Monitor performance, optimize where possible
- **Low Score (&lt;5.0)**: Consider adjusting campaign targeting

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **Reach**: Total impressions delivered with signal combinations
- **Cost Efficiency**: CPM performance relative to quality
- **Conversion Rate**: Actions taken per impression
- **Quality Score**: Media quality metrics from Scope3 signals
