## Common Use Cases

### Family-Safe Content Filtering
Ensure all content is appropriate for family audiences by rejecting anything containing violence, adult themes, or profanity while approving educational and lifestyle content.

```
"Ensure all content is appropriate for family audiences. Reject anything containing violence, adult themes, profanity, or inappropriate imagery. Approve educational, entertainment, and lifestyle content that aligns with family values."
```

### Premium Brand Safety
Maintain premium brand positioning by only accepting high-quality, professionally produced content while avoiding anything that could diminish brand prestige.

```
"Maintain premium brand positioning by only accepting high-quality, professionally produced content. Avoid user-generated content, controversial topics, or anything that could diminish brand prestige. Focus on luxury, quality, and exclusivity messaging."
```

### Regional Compliance
Ensure content complies with local regulations like GDPR while prioritizing transparency and user privacy.

```
"Ensure all content complies with GDPR and EU privacy regulations. Reject any content that doesn't clearly indicate data collection practices or lacks proper consent mechanisms. Prioritize transparency and user privacy."
```

## How Standards Work

### Automatic Application
- All campaigns within a brand agent inherit these standards
- New campaigns automatically use current safety rules
- Standards apply to creative approval and content classification

### Content Classification
- Incoming content is evaluated against your safety rules
- AI uses your natural language prompts to make approval decisions
- Classifications help ensure brand-safe media placements

### Targeting Flexibility
- Standards can target specific markets, channels, or languages
- Multiple standards can operate simultaneously with different targeting
- Market-appropriate safety rules for different regions

## Configuration Examples

### Multi-Channel Standards
```json
{
  "name": "Social Media Safety",
  "prompt": "Review social media content for brand appropriateness. Avoid controversial political content, ensure family-friendly messaging, and maintain professional tone.",
  "channels": ["social", "mobile"],
  "countries": ["US", "CA", "GB"],
  "languages": ["en"]
}
```

### Region-Specific Standards
```json
{
  "name": "EU Compliance Standards",
  "prompt": "Ensure compliance with EU regulations including GDPR, transparency requirements, and local advertising standards.",
  "countries": ["DE", "FR", "NL", "IT", "ES"],
  "languages": ["de", "fr", "nl", "it", "es"]
}
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Effective Prompts
- **Be specific**: Clear, detailed safety requirements work better than vague guidelines
- **Use examples**: Include specific scenarios to guide AI decision-making  
- **Consider edge cases**: Address boundary situations in your prompts
- **Test and refine**: Create, test, and adjust prompts based on results

### Targeting Strategy
- **Start broad**: Begin with general standards, then add market-specific ones
- **Layer specificity**: Use multiple standards for different requirements (e.g., family safety, compliance)
- **Monitor performance**: Review classification accuracy and adjust prompts as needed

### Management
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive names that indicate the purpose
- **Regular updates**: Keep standards current with changing brand requirements
- **Market relevance**: Ensure standards are appropriate for targeted regions
