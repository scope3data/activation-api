## Overview

The `campaign_create` tool creates new campaigns within a brand agent context with integrated AI-powered brief validation. By default, all campaign briefs are automatically validated against [Ad Context Protocol standards](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/media-buy/product-discovery/brief-expectations) to ensure they contain the essential information publishers need for effective inventory matching.

<Warning>
**Campaign Creation Blocked for Low-Quality Briefs**

If your campaign brief scores below the quality threshold (default 70/100), creation will fail with detailed feedback. You must either improve the brief or explicitly skip validation using `skipBriefValidation: true`.
</Warning>

## Why Integrated Validation?

Publishers require specific information to match campaigns with appropriate inventory:

- **Geographic targeting** - Essential for finding relevant inventory locations
- **Flight dates** - Critical for inventory availability and reservation
- **Creative specifications** - Required for matching ad formats and placements  
- **Audience details** - Needed for targeting optimization
- **Measurable objectives** - Important for campaign scaling decisions

The integrated validation prevents campaign creation failures by ensuring this essential information is present upfront.

## Brief Validation Integration

### Default Behavior: Automatic Validation
By default, every campaign creation includes brief validation:

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123",
  "name": "Nike Air Max Spring Campaign",
  "prompt": "Launch Nike Air Max campaign targeting urban millennials 25-35...",
  "budget": {
    "total": 25000000,  // $250,000
    "currency": "USD",
    "dailyCap": 1200000, // $12,000/day
    "pacing": "even"
  }
  // Validation runs automatically with threshold: 70
}
```

### Custom Validation Thresholds
Set higher quality requirements for premium campaigns:

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123",
  "name": "Nike Premium CTV Campaign",
  "prompt": "Premium campaign brief with detailed targeting...",
  "budget": { "total": 50000000 },
  "briefValidationThreshold": 85  // Higher standard
}
```

### Skip Validation for Pre-Validated Briefs
Avoid duplicate processing when you've already validated the brief:

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123", 
  "name": "Pre-Validated Campaign",
  "prompt": "Already validated comprehensive brief...",
  "budget": { "total": 25000000 },
  "skipBriefValidation": true  // Skip to save processing time
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Standard Campaign Creation

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123",
  "name": "Nike Spring Athletic Campaign",
  "prompt": "Launch athletic wear campaign targeting fitness enthusiasts 25-40 in major US cities. Run March-May 2025 with 15s/30s video for CTV and 300x250 display banners. Target $2.50 CPM with 20M impressions. Focus on urban markets: NYC, LA, Chicago, Seattle metro areas.",
  "budget": {

    "pacing": "even"
  },
  "startDate": "2025-03-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-05-31T23:59:59Z",

## Best Practice Workflows

### Recommended: Validate First, Create Second

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate Brief Quality">
    Use `campaign_validate_brief` to check completeness and get improvement suggestions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve Brief">
    Address missing elements based on AI feedback
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Campaign">
    Use `campaign_create` with `skipBriefValidation: true` to avoid duplicate validation

## Brief Quality Requirements

### The 6 Critical Elements

Publishers require these elements for successful inventory matching:

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title="1. Business Objectives">
    **Required:** Clear, measurable goals
    
    **Good Example:** "Increase brand awareness by 30% among target demographic"  
    **Poor Example:** "Build awareness" (not measurable)
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="2. Success Metrics">
    **Required:** Specific KPIs with targets
    
    **Good Example:** "Target 2.5% CTR with minimum 15M impressions"  
    **Poor Example:** "Good engagement" (not specific)
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="3. Target Audience">
    **Required:** Detailed demographics and interests
    
    **Good Example:** "Urban millennials 25-35, income $50k+, sustainability-focused"  
    **Poor Example:** "Young people" (too broad)
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="4. Geographic Markets ⚠️ CRITICAL">
    **Required:** Specific locations for inventory matching
    
    **Good Example:** "Tier 1 US cities: NYC, LA, Chicago, SF metro areas"  
    **Poor Example:** "Major markets" (unclear)
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="5. Flight Dates ⚠️ CRITICAL">
    **Required:** Campaign timing for inventory availability
    
    **Good Example:** "March 1 - April 15, 2025 (6-week campaign)"  
    **Poor Example:** "Next quarter" (too vague)
  </AccordionItem>
  
  <AccordionItem title="6. Creative Requirements ⚠️ CRITICAL">
    **Required:** Formats and specifications for inventory matching
    
    **Good Example:** "15s/30s video ads plus 728x90 display banners"  
    **Poor Example:** "Creative content" (no specs)
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

### Quality Scoring

- **Missing ANY critical requirement** = automatic score below 60
- **Missing 2+ critical requirements** = score capped at 40  
- **Missing 3+ critical requirements** = score capped at 30

<Warning>
**Campaign Creation Threshold**

Default threshold is 70/100. Campaigns with lower scores will be rejected unless validation is explicitly skipped.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

### Validation Failures
When briefs don't meet quality standards:

1. **Detailed Error Message** - Shows score, missing elements, and suggestions
2. **Improvement Guidance** - Specific actions to address each gap
3. **Bypass Option** - Ability to skip validation if needed

### Authentication Errors
- Missing or invalid API key results in authentication error
- Check `SCOPE3_API_KEY` environment variable or session context

### Parameter Validation Errors
- Invalid budget amounts (must be positive integers in cents)
- Invalid date formats (must be ISO 8601 UTC)
- Invalid brand agent or creative IDs
