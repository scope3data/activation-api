## Overview

The `campaign_validate_brief` tool provides AI-powered validation of campaign briefs against [Ad Context Protocol standards](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/media-buy/product-discovery/brief-expectations). This standalone validation tool helps ensure your campaign briefs contain the essential information publishers need for effective inventory matching and campaign execution.

<Tip>
**Best Practice Workflow**

Use this tool to validate and improve your brief first, then create campaigns with `skipBriefValidation: true` to save processing time and reduce carbon footprint from duplicate AI evaluations.
</Tip>

## Why Validate Briefs?

Publishers require specific information to effectively match campaigns with appropriate inventory:

- **Geographic targeting** - Essential for inventory location matching
- **Flight dates** - Critical for inventory availability and reservation  
- **Creative specifications** - Required for format and placement matching
- **Audience details** - Needed for targeting optimization
- **Budget and objectives** - Important for campaign scaling and pacing

Without complete briefs, campaigns may fail to find suitable inventory or deliver suboptimal results.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `brief` | string | Yes | The campaign brief text to validate against Ad Context Protocol standards |
| `threshold` | number | No | Minimum quality score required to pass validation (0-100, default: 70) |
| `brandAgentId` | string | No | Optional brand agent ID for context-aware validation |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Validation

```javascript
{
  "brief": "Launch a premium athletic wear campaign targeting young adults interested in fitness and outdoor activities. Focus on urban markets with high disposable income. Creative should emphasize sustainability and performance.",
  "threshold": 70
}
```

### Comprehensive Brief Example

```javascript
{
  "brief": "Launch Nike Air Max campaign targeting urban millennials 25-35 with household income $50k+, focused on fitness/lifestyle interests. Run March 1 - April 15, 2025 across tier 1 US cities (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF metro areas). Objectives: Achieve 30% brand awareness lift and 15M impressions. Success metrics: 2.5% CTR target, 40% video completion rate. Creative requirements: 15s/30s video ads for CTV/YouTube, plus 728x90 and 300x250 display banners. Total budget $250k with $12k daily cap, even pacing strategy.",
  "threshold": 80,
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123"
}
```

## Response Format

The tool returns comprehensive validation results:

### Success Response

{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "validation": {
      "score": 85,
      "meetsThreshold": true,
      "threshold": 70,
      "qualityLevel": "Comprehensive Brief",
      "feedback": "This brief contains all critical elements publishers need for effective inventory matching. Geographic targeting, flight dates, and creative specifications are clearly defined, enabling optimal campaign execution.",
      "missingElements": [],
      "suggestions": [
        "Consider specifying exact video completion rate targets for CTV inventory",
        "Add brand safety requirements for premium inventory placement"
      ]
    },

    }
  },
  "message": "✅ Brief Ready for Campaign Creation\n\n**Overall Score: 85/100** ✅\n**Quality Level:** Comprehensive Brief\n**Status:** PASSES validation requirements..."
}
```

### Failure Response

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "❌ Brief Needs Improvement\n\n**Score:** 45/100 (Required: 70/100)\n**Quality Level:** Minimal Brief\n\n**Missing Critical Elements:**\n• Geographic targeting not defined - CRITICAL for inventory matching\n• Campaign flight dates not specified - CRITICAL for inventory availability\n• Creative format requirements not defined - CRITICAL for inventory matching..."
}
```

## Quality Scoring

### Scoring Ranges

- **80-100 (Comprehensive)**: Complete brief with all elements and detailed specifications
- **60-79 (Standard)**: Good brief with most key elements, minor gaps acceptable
- **30-59 (Minimal)**: Basic information but missing important details
- **0-29 (No Brief)**: Insufficient information for effective campaigns

### Critical Requirement Impact

<Warning>
**Score Capping Logic**

- Missing ANY critical requirement = automatic score below 60
- Missing 2+ critical requirements = score capped at 40  
- Missing 3+ critical requirements = score capped at 30

This reflects the reality that publishers cannot effectively match campaigns without essential targeting information.
</Warning>

## The 6 Critical Requirements

### 1. Business Objectives ✅
Clear, measurable goals that define campaign success.

**Good:** "Increase brand awareness by 30% among target demographic"  
**Poor:** "Build awareness" (not measurable)

### 2. Success Metrics ✅ 
Specific KPIs with measurable targets.

**Good:** "Target 2.5% CTR with minimum 15M impressions"  
**Poor:** "Good engagement rates" (not specific)

### 3. Target Audience ✅
Detailed demographics, psychographics, and interests.

**Good:** "Urban millennials 25-35, household income $50k+, sustainability-focused"  
**Poor:** "Young people" (too broad)

### 4. Geographic Markets ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
Specific locations, regions, or targeting areas for inventory matching.

**Good:** "Tier 1 US cities: NYC, LA, Chicago, San Francisco metro areas"  
**Poor:** "Major markets" (unclear definition)

### 5. Flight Dates ⚠️ **CRITICAL** 
Campaign timing for inventory reservation and availability.

**Good:** "March 1 - April 15, 2025 (6-week campaign)"  
**Poor:** "Next quarter" (too vague)

### 6. Creative Requirements ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
Formats, sizes, and specifications needed for inventory matching.

**Good:** "15-second and 30-second video ads, plus 728x90 display banners"  
**Poor:** "Creative content" (no specifications)

## AI Evaluation Process

The validation uses advanced AI models to:

1. **Parse Brief Content** - Extract key information and requirements
2. **Compare Against Standards** - Evaluate against Ad Context Protocol guidelines  
3. **Identify Gaps** - Detect missing critical elements
4. **Generate Suggestions** - Provide specific, actionable improvement recommendations
5. **Assign Quality Score** - Calculate 0-100 score based on completeness

## Error Handling

### AI Service Unavailable
If the AI evaluation service is unavailable, the tool falls back to pattern-based validation:

- Searches for keywords indicating each requirement category
- Provides basic scoring based on content analysis  
- Returns general suggestions for improvement
- Maintains core functionality during service outages

### Invalid Input
- Brief text cannot be empty
- Threshold must be between 0-100
- Brand agent ID must be valid format if provided

## Integration with Campaign Creation

This tool works seamlessly with the campaign creation workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Validate Brief">
    Use `campaign_validate_brief` to assess quality and get improvement suggestions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Improve Based on Feedback">
    Address missing elements and implement AI suggestions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Campaign">
    Use `campaign_create` with `skipBriefValidation: true` to avoid duplicate validation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Use Cases

### Pre-Campaign Quality Check
```javascript
// Validate before any campaign creation
{
  "brief": "Your campaign description here...",
  "threshold": 70
}
```

### High-Quality Campaign Requirements
```javascript
// Higher standards for premium campaigns
{
  "brief": "Premium campaign brief...",
  "threshold": 85
}
```

### Brand-Specific Validation
```javascript
// Context-aware validation for specific advertisers
{
  "brief": "Brand-specific campaign brief...",
  "threshold": 70,
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123"
}
```
