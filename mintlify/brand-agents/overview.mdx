## What is a Brand Agent?

A **Brand Agent** is the advertiser's account within the Scope3 Campaign API - the central hub that owns all the advertiser's marketing assets and campaigns. Think of it as the brand's advertising headquarters that coordinates all programmatic marketing activities.

<Note>
**Industry Standard**: Brand agents mirror the advertiser account pattern used by major platforms like Google Ads, The Trade Desk, and Facebook Business Manager.
</Note>

## Why Brand Agents Matter

### The Foundation of Everything
Brand agents are the **foundational layer** of the Scope3 API. Every resource - campaigns, creatives, audiences, and settings - belongs to a brand agent. This provides:

- **Centralized Management**: All the advertiser's marketing assets in one place
- **Resource Sharing**: Creatives and audiences reused across campaigns
- **Brand Consistency**: Unified safety rules and standards for the brand
- **Access Control**: Team permissions and API key scoping
- **Performance Analytics**: Cross-campaign insights and optimization
