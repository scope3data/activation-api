<Info>
**Quick Start**: This 5-minute integration sets up creative workflows to improve campaign management and reduce operational overhead.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Integration Goal**: By the end of this guide, you'll have a working creative system that can create, assign, and manage creatives for your campaigns.
</Tip>

## What You'll Build (5 Minutes)

‚úÖ **Working creative system** with enterprise-grade asset handling  
‚úÖ **Campaign-creative integration** for streamlined workflow management  
‚úÖ **Asset organization** for efficient creative operations  
‚úÖ **Scalable architecture** ready for large-scale creative operations

## Prerequisites (1 Minute Setup)

<Steps>
<Step title="Brand Agent Required">
**Need a buyer agent first?** 
```bash
"Create a brand agent for [Your Brand Name]"
```
‚úÖ **Result**: Returns `buyerAgentId` (e.g., `ba_123`) for creative ownership
</Step>

<Step title="API Authentication">
**Scope3 API key in headers:**
```bash
X-Scope3-API-Key: your_api_key
# OR
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 1: Create Creative with Format & Content (2 minutes)

<Warning>
**ARCHITECTURE UPDATE**: Creative management now uses **MCP orchestration + REST upload** architecture. This step creates creatives with **real-world content sources** (HTML snippets, JavaScript tags, VAST tags, asset references).
</Warning>

**Developer Goal**: Create a production-ready creative using the **most common enterprise workflow** - third-party ad server tags.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Natural Language (Most Common Workflow)
"Create a creative called 'Holiday Sale 2024' for buyer agent ba_123 using HTML snippet from Google Ad Manager"
```

```json Tool Call (HTML Snippet - 80% of Real Use Cases)
{
  "tool": "creative/create",
  "parameters": {
    "buyerAgentId": "ba_123",
    "creativeName": "Holiday Sale 2024",
    "format": {
      "type": "publisher",
      "formatId": "display_banner"
    },
    "content": {
      "htmlSnippet": "<div class='ad-unit'>\n  <img src='https://cdn.adserver.com/holiday-banner.jpg' />\n  <h2>Save 50% This Holiday Season</h2>\n  <button onclick='window.open(\"https://yourstore.com/sale\")'\'>Shop Now</button>\n</div>"
    },
    "advertiserDomains": ["yourstore.com"],
    "assemblyMethod": "pre_assembled"
  }
}
```

```json Tool Call (Asset Assembly - 15% of Use Cases)
{
  "tool": "creative/create", 
  "parameters": {
    "buyerAgentId": "ba_123",
    "creativeName": "Holiday Sale 2024",
    "format": {
      "type": "adcp",
      "formatId": "display_banner"
    },
    "content": {
      "assetIds": ["asset_img_123", "asset_txt_456"]
    },
    "advertiserDomains": ["yourstore.com"],
    "assemblyMethod": "publisher"
  }
}
```

```json Tool Call (JavaScript Tag - Enterprise Workflow)
{
  "tool": "creative/create",
  "parameters": {
    "buyerAgentId": "ba_123", 
    "creativeName": "Holiday Sale 2024",
    "format": {
      "type": "publisher",
      "formatId": "display_banner"
    },
    "content": {
      "javascriptTag": "<script src='https://sizmek.com/ad/12345/holiday-creative.js'></script>"
    },
    "advertiserDomains": ["yourstore.com"],
    "assemblyMethod": "pre_assembled"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

**API Response (Critical Data for Integration):**
```json
{
  "creativeId": "creative_abc123",
  "creativeName": "Holiday Sale 2024",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "buyerAgentId": "ba_123",
  "status": "draft",
  "format": {
    "type": "publisher",
    "formatId": "display_banner"
  },
  "content": {
    "htmlSnippet": "<div class='ad-unit'>\n  <img src='https://cdn.adserver.com/holiday-banner.jpg' />\n  <h2>Save 50% This Holiday Season</h2>\n  <button onclick='window.open(\"https://yourstore.com/sale\")'\'>Shop Now</button>\n</div>"
  },
  "assemblyMethod": "pre_assembled",
  "advertiserDomains": ["yourstore.com"],
  "campaignAssignments": [],
  "createdDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "lastModifiedDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**‚úÖ Integration Checkpoint**: Creative with real-world content is ready for enterprise campaign deployment

**üèóÔ∏è Architecture Note**: This creative contains an HTML snippet (the most common enterprise use case) and will be served via the publisher's ad serving infrastructure.

## Step 2: Deploy to Campaign (1 minute)

<Tip>
**Integration Note**: This step connects your creative to campaign performance data. Essential for A/B testing and optimization.
</Tip>

**Developer Goal**: Deploy creative to production campaign and enable performance tracking.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Natural Language
"Assign creative creative_abc123 to campaign camp_456 for buyer agent ba_123"
```

```json Tool Call
{
  "tool": "creative/assign", 
  "parameters": {
    "creativeId": "creative_abc123",
    "campaignId": "camp_456", 
    "buyerAgentId": "ba_123"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

**API Response (Assignment Confirmation):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "assignment": {
    "creativeId": "creative_abc123", 
    "campaignId": "camp_456",
    "buyerAgentId": "ba_123",
    "assignedDate": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z",
    "status": "active"
  },
  "campaign": {
    "campaignName": "Holiday Campaign 2024",
    "status": "active",
    "budget": 50000
  }
}
```

**‚úÖ Integration Checkpoint**: Creative is now live and performance tracking is enabled

## Step 3: Monitor Performance (30 seconds)

<Info>
**Why This Matters**: Performance monitoring is critical for optimization. Top-performing creatives can be scaled across campaigns for 25-40% ROI improvement.
</Info>

**Developer Goal**: Access real-time creative performance data for optimization decisions.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Natural Language
"Show me all creatives for campaign camp_456"
```

```json Tool Call
{
  "tool": "campaign/list_creatives",
  "parameters": {
    "campaignId": "camp_456"
  }
}
```

</CodeGroup>

**API Response (Performance Analytics):**
```json
{
  "campaignId": "camp_456",
  "creatives": [
    {
      "creativeId": "creative_abc123",
      "creativeName": "Holiday Sale 2024",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "status": "active",
      "assignedDate": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z",
      "performance": {
        "impressions": 12450,
        "clicks": 234,
        "ctr": 1.88,
        "conversions": 47,
        "conversionRate": 20.09,
        "costPerConversion": 8.45,
        "performanceGrade": "A"
      },
      "optimization": {
        "recommendation": "Scale to similar campaigns",
        "confidence": "high",
        "reason": "CTR above 1.5% threshold"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**‚úÖ Success**: Full creative management integration complete with performance optimization!

## Developer FAQ

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Architecture: How does MCP orchestration + REST work?">
**MCP Layer**: Handles creative orchestration, format specification, content sources via natural language
**REST Layer**: Handles actual file uploads via presigned URLs, CDN uploads, bulk operations

**Why**: MCP protocol isn't designed for binary file transfers. This architecture enables real-world enterprise workflows.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Content: What content types are most common?">
**HTML Snippets (80%)**: Pre-built creative code from ad servers (DCM, GAM, Sizmek)
**JavaScript Tags (15%)**: Dynamic ad tags from third-party platforms
**Asset Assembly (5%)**: Upload assets via REST, reference by ID for publisher assembly

**Technical**: Most enterprises use third-party ad servers, not direct asset uploads.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Scaling: Can creatives be reused across campaigns?">
**Yes - This is the core value proposition!** 
- One creative can be assigned to unlimited campaigns
- Reduces creative production costs by 60-80%
- Enables centralized creative performance analytics
- Must be within same buyer agent for security
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Versioning: What happens when I update assigned creatives?">
**Safe Update Pattern**:
- Updates create new versions (v1.0 ‚Üí v1.1)
- Active campaigns continue using assigned version
- No campaign disruption during creative updates  
- Update campaign assignments explicitly when ready
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Formats: How do I know which format to use?">
**Format Discovery Pattern**:
1. Use `list_creative_formats` to see available formats
2. Choose based on content type and assembly needs
3. AdCP formats for standard workflows
4. Publisher formats for custom requirements
5. Creative agent formats for AI generation

**Most Common**: `publisher/display_banner` with `content.htmlSnippet`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multi-Tenancy: How to organize multiple brands?">
**Buyer Agent Isolation Strategy**:
- Separate buyer agents per brand (security boundary)
- Each buyer agent = isolated creative library
- Cross-brand creative sharing requires explicit permission
- Enables per-brand billing and access control
</Accordion>
