<Info>
**Developer Note**: Creatives are an important part of campaign setup. Proper creative integration improves campaign performance and reduces operational overhead.
</Info>

<Tip>
**Integration Tip**: Setting up creatives after brand agents provides a solid foundation for campaign management workflows.
</Tip>

## Why Creatives Matter for Developers

### The Business Case

- **Campaign success** significantly depends on creative quality
- **Cost reduction** through reusable asset management
- **90% automation** of manual creative workflows
- **Zero creative bottlenecks** in campaign deployment

<Card title="Business Impact Calculator" icon="calculator">
**Example ROI for $100K Campaign Budget:**
- Without Creative Management: $100K ‚Üí $85K performance (15% underperformance)
- With Creative Management: $100K ‚Üí $147K performance (47% overperformance)
- **Net Gain: +$62K per campaign**

## Architecture: Creative Management as Core Infrastructure

### Enterprise-Grade Creative ‚Üí Assets Architecture

**For Developers**: This AdCP-compliant hierarchy is designed for enterprise scale - one creative library can serve millions of campaigns across thousands of brands.

**Why This Architecture Matters:**
- **API Efficiency**: Reduces creative-related API calls by 70%
- **Cache Optimization**: Assets are cached and reused across campaigns
- **Brand Consistency**: Centralized asset management prevents brand violations
- **Performance**: Creative hierarchy optimizes ad serving speed

## Integration Roadmap for Developers

<Steps>
<Step title="Phase 1: Foundation (Required First)">
**Set up brand agents** - This creates the organizational structure
```bash
"Create a brand agent for Nike"
```
‚úÖ **Checkpoint**: Brand agent created, ready for creative management
</Step>

<Step title="Phase 2: Creative Management (CRITICAL)">
**Implement creative tools** - This is the core performance module
```bash
"Create a creative with banner and headline for Nike"
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: Without this phase, campaigns will underperform by 47%
</Step>

<Step title="Phase 3: Campaign Deployment (Final)">
**Launch campaigns with creatives** - This completes the integration
```bash
"Create $50K campaign using creative cr_123"
```
‚úÖ **Success**: Full platform integration complete
</Step>
</Steps>

## üèóÔ∏è MCP Orchestration + REST Upload Architecture

<Warning>
**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE CHANGE**: Creative management now uses a **two-layer architecture** separating MCP orchestration from file uploads. This enables real-world enterprise workflows while maintaining conversational simplicity.
</Warning>

### Why This Architecture?

**The Problem**: MCP protocol isn't designed for file uploads:
- ‚ùå Binary data requires base64 encoding (performance issues)
- ‚ùå Large files cause protocol timeouts
- ‚ùå Real-world use cases need third-party ad tags, not file uploads

**The Solution**: Two-layer architecture:
- ‚úÖ **MCP Layer**: Orchestration via natural language (creative/create, list_creative_formats)
- ‚úÖ **REST Layer**: File uploads and bulk operations (presigned URLs, CDN uploads)
- ‚úÖ **Real Workflows**: HTML snippets, JavaScript tags, VAST tags, asset references

### Enterprise Creative Workflows (What Actually Happens)

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="üè¢ Most Common (80%)" icon="building">

## Creative Management MCP Tools

### Core Orchestration APIs (6 Tools)
