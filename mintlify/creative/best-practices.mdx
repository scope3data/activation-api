<Tip>
**For Engineering Teams**: These practices are based on real-world deployments managing millions of creative assets across thousands of campaigns. Follow these patterns to avoid common pitfalls and optimize for scale.
</Tip>

## Architecture Patterns for Scale

### Pattern #1: Creative-First Architecture (Recommended)

**Best for**: Enterprise clients, brand consistency, cost optimization

```typescript
// Implementation Order (MCP Orchestration + REST)
1. Brand Agent Foundation → create_brand_agent()
2. Format Discovery → list_creative_formats() (understand available formats)
3. Asset Upload via REST → Use REST endpoints for file uploads, get asset references
4. Asset References → assets/add() (create asset references from REST uploads)
5. Creative Template Creation → creative/create() with format specs and content sources
6. Campaign Deployment → creative/assign() (assign proven creatives to campaigns)
7. Performance Optimization → campaign/list_creatives() (data-driven creative decisions)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **60-80% cost reduction** in creative production
- ✅ **Brand consistency** across all campaigns  
- ✅ **API efficiency** through asset reuse
- ✅ **Faster campaign launches** with pre-built creative library

**Implementation Tips:**
- Create asset libraries during initial setup
- Use descriptive naming conventions for easy discovery
- Implement creative versioning for safe updates
- Cache creative responses for management interfaces

---

### Pattern #2: Campaign-First Architecture

**Best for**: Agencies, rapid iteration, campaign-specific messaging

```typescript
// Implementation Order (MCP Orchestration Focus)
1. Brand Agent Foundation → create_brand_agent()
2. Format Discovery → list_creative_formats() (choose optimal formats)
3. Campaign Creation → create_campaign()
4. Creative Development → campaign/attach_creative() with HTML snippets/JS tags
5. Rapid Testing → creative/create() with different content sources
6. Winner Scaling → creative/assign() (promote successful creatives)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **25-40% performance improvement** through optimization
- ✅ **Faster time-to-market** for new campaigns
- ✅ **Campaign-specific optimization** 
- ✅ **A/B testing workflows** built-in

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use inline creative creation for speed
- Implement performance tracking from day one
- Scale winning creatives across campaigns
- Archive underperforming creatives quickly

## Production Deployment Guidelines

### Database and Caching Strategy

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Database Optimization" icon="database">
**Partition Strategy:**
- Use `buyerAgentId` as partition key
- Index on `creativeName` for searches
- Separate tables for assets vs creatives
- Archive old creatives, don't delete

**Query Optimization:**
- Always filter by `buyerAgentId` first
- Use `limit`/`offset` for pagination
- Cache creative lists for management UIs
- Pre-load campaign assignments
</Card>

<Card title="CDN and Asset Management" icon="cloud">
**Asset Storage:**
- CDN-optimize all creative assets
- Generate multiple image sizes automatically
- Implement lazy loading for asset libraries
- Use WebP/AVIF for modern browsers

**Caching Strategy:**
- Cache creative metadata (5min TTL)
- Cache campaign assignments (1min TTL) 
- Cache asset URLs indefinitely
- Invalidate on creative updates
</Card>

</CardGroup>

### API Integration Patterns

#### MCP Orchestration Pattern

```typescript
// ❌ Inefficient: File uploads via MCP (wrong architecture)
await creative/create({
  assets: [{ fileContent: base64EncodedData }]  // DON'T DO THIS
});

// ✅ Efficient: MCP orchestration + REST uploads
// 1. Upload files via REST API
const uploadResult = await restClient.uploadAsset(file);

// 2. Create asset references via MCP
await assets/add({
  assetUrl: uploadResult.cdnUrl,
  uploadId: uploadResult.uploadId
});

// 3. Create creative via MCP orchestration
await creative/create({
  format: { type: 'publisher', formatId: 'display_banner' },
  content: { assetIds: [uploadResult.assetId] }
});
```

#### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// ✅ Production-ready error handling
try {
  const creative = await creative/create({...params});
  
  // Success: Continue workflow
  return { success: true, creativeId: creative.creativeId };
  
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'BUYER_AGENT_NOT_FOUND') {
    // Handle: Create buyer agent first
    await create_brand_agent({...});
    return retryCreativeCreation();
  }
  
  if (error.code === 'ASSET_UPLOAD_FAILED') {
    // Handle: Retry with different asset
    return fallbackAssetStrategy();
  }
  
  // Log and escalate unknown errors
  logger.error('Creative creation failed', error);
  throw error;
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Creative Library Management

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Naming Conventions">
**Strategic Naming for Scale:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Descriptive with format and content type
creativeName: "Nike_Q1_2024_Spring_HTML_Banner_Desktop_v2"
creativeName: "Starbucks_Holiday_JS_Tag_Mobile_GAM_v1"
creativeName: "Tesla_Model3_VAST_Video_CTV_30s_v3"
creativeName: "Brand_Logo_Asset_Reference_2024_Primary"

// ❌ Bad: Generic and hard to find  
creativeName: "banner1"
creativeName: "video_final"
creativeName: "creative_v2"
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast creative discovery in large libraries
- Clear asset specifications for teams
- Version control for safe updates
- Campaign assignment clarity
</Tab>

<Tab title="Asset Organization">
**Library Structure:**

```typescript
// Organize by content source and format
"HTML_Snippets": Nike_Spring_HTML_Banner_Desktop_v1
"JS_Tags": Starbucks_Holiday_GAM_Tag_Mobile_v2
"VAST_Tags": Tesla_CTV_Video_VAST_30s_v1
"Asset_References": Brand_Logo_CDN_Reference_2024

// Tag by format and assembly method
tags: ["html_snippet", "pre_assembled", "desktop"]
tags: ["js_tag", "gam", "mobile", "dynamic"]
tags: ["vast_tag", "video", "ctv", "30_second"]
tags: ["asset_reference", "logo", "brand_tier"]
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Performance Monitoring">
**Key Metrics to Track:**

```typescript
// Creative performance KPIs
- CTR by creative (>2% is excellent)
- Conversion rate by creative
- Cost per conversion by creative
- Creative fatigue detection (CTR decline >20%)

// System performance KPIs  
- API response time (<100ms for creative/list)
- Asset load time (<2s for images, <5s for videos)
- Cache hit rate (>90% for management UIs)
- Error rate (<1% for all creative operations)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Enterprise Integration Patterns

### Multi-Brand Management

```typescript
// ✅ Proper multi-brand isolation
const brandAgents = [
  { name: "Nike", buyerAgentId: "ba_nike_123" },
  { name: "Adidas", buyerAgentId: "ba_adidas_456" },
  { name: "Puma", buyerAgentId: "ba_puma_789" }
];

// Each brand gets isolated creative library
for (const brand of brandAgents) {
  await creative/list({ buyerAgentId: brand.buyerAgentId });
}
```

### Creative Approval Workflows

```typescript
// Production approval flow
1. Create → status: "draft"
2. Review → status: "pending_review"  
3. Approve → status: "active"
4. Deploy → creative/assign to campaigns
5. Monitor → campaign/list_creatives for performance
6. Archive → status: "archived" (never delete)
```

### A/B Testing at Scale

```typescript
// Systematic A/B testing
const testCreatives = await creative/create({
  creativeName: "Holiday_Sale_Test_Variant_A",
  assets: [...variantAAssets]
});

const controlCreatives = await creative/create({
  creativeName: "Holiday_Sale_Test_Control", 
  assets: [...controlAssets]
});

// Split campaign assignment
await campaign/attach_creative({
  campaignId: "camp_test_A",
  creativeIds: [testCreatives.creativeId] 
});

await campaign/attach_creative({
  campaignId: "camp_control", 
  creativeIds: [controlCreatives.creativeId]
});

// Monitor and promote winner
const performanceA = await campaign/list_creatives({ campaignId: "camp_test_A" });
const performanceControl = await campaign/list_creatives({ campaignId: "camp_control" });

if (performanceA.ctr > performanceControl.ctr * 1.1) {
  // Scale winning creative to other campaigns
  await scaleWinnerToAllCampaigns(testCreatives.creativeId);
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Using MCP for File Uploads

**Problem:** Attempting to upload files via MCP protocol (wrong architecture).

```typescript  
// ❌ This is wrong - MCP not designed for file transfers
await creative/create({
  assets: [{
    fileContent: base64EncodedLargeVideo,  // DON'T DO THIS
    assetType: "video"
  }]
});
```

**Impact:** 
- Protocol timeouts on large files
- Poor performance due to base64 encoding
- Doesn't match real enterprise workflows
- Missing format specification

**✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// Correct: MCP orchestration + REST uploads
1. await create_brand_agent({ name: "Nike" });
2. await list_creative_formats();  // Discover formats
3. await creative/create({
     format: { type: 'publisher', formatId: 'display_banner' },
     content: { htmlSnippet: '<div>Ad content</div>' }  // Real workflow
   });
4. await create_campaign({ creativeIds: [...], ... });
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Wrong Content Source Type

**Problem:** Not using the right content source for enterprise workflows.

```typescript
// ❌ Trying to recreate what ad servers already provide
creativeName: "banner1", "video_final", "image_v2"
content: { assetIds: [...] }  // When you should use HTML snippets
```

**✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// Use the right content source for your workflow

// Most common (80%): HTML snippets from ad servers
creativeName: "Nike_Q1_GAM_HTML_Banner_Desktop_v1"
content: { htmlSnippet: '<div>Pre-built ad from GAM</div>' }

// Enterprise (15%): JavaScript tags
creativeName: "Brand_Sizmek_JS_Tag_Mobile_v2" 
content: { javascriptTag: '<script src="..."></script>' }

// Video (5%): VAST tags
creativeName: "Product_CTV_VAST_30s_v1"
content: { vastTag: '<VAST version="3.0">...</VAST>' }
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Not Monitoring Performance

**Problem:** Creating creatives but not tracking their performance.

**✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// Regular performance analysis
const performance = await campaign/list_creatives({ 
  campaignId,
  includePerformance: true 
});

// Archive poor performers (CTR < 1%)
// Scale high performers (CTR > 3%)  
// Test variants of medium performers (CTR 1-3%)
```
