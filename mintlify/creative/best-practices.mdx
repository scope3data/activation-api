<Tip>
**For Engineering Teams**: These practices are based on real-world deployments managing millions of creative assets across thousands of campaigns. Follow these patterns to avoid common pitfalls and optimize for scale.
</Tip>

## Architecture Patterns for Scale

### Pattern #1: Creative-First Architecture (Recommended)

**Best for**: Enterprise clients, brand consistency, cost optimization

```typescript
// Implementation Order
1. Brand Agent Foundation → create_brand_agent()
2. Asset Library Setup → creative/upload_asset() (logos, templates, brand guidelines)  
3. Creative Template Creation → creative/create() (reusable creative frameworks)
4. Campaign Deployment → creative/assign() (assign proven creatives to campaigns)
5. Performance Optimization → campaign/list_creatives() (data-driven creative decisions)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **60-80% cost reduction** in creative production
- ✅ **Brand consistency** across all campaigns  
- ✅ **API efficiency** through asset reuse
- ✅ **Faster campaign launches** with pre-built creative library

**Implementation Tips:**
- Create asset libraries during initial setup
- Use descriptive naming conventions for easy discovery
- Implement creative versioning for safe updates
- Cache creative responses for management interfaces

---

### Pattern #2: Campaign-First Architecture

**Best for**: Agencies, rapid iteration, campaign-specific messaging

```typescript
// Implementation Order  
1. Brand Agent Foundation → create_brand_agent()
2. Campaign Creation → create_campaign()
3. Creative Development → campaign/attach_creative() with newCreatives
4. Rapid Testing → creative/create() (multiple variants) 
5. Winner Scaling → creative/assign() (promote successful creatives)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **25-40% performance improvement** through optimization
- ✅ **Faster time-to-market** for new campaigns
- ✅ **Campaign-specific optimization** 
- ✅ **A/B testing workflows** built-in

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use inline creative creation for speed
- Implement performance tracking from day one
- Scale winning creatives across campaigns
- Archive underperforming creatives quickly

## Production Deployment Guidelines

### Database and Caching Strategy

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="Database Optimization" icon="database">
**Partition Strategy:**
- Use `buyerAgentId` as partition key
- Index on `creativeName` for searches
- Separate tables for assets vs creatives
- Archive old creatives, don't delete

**Query Optimization:**
- Always filter by `buyerAgentId` first
- Use `limit`/`offset` for pagination
- Cache creative lists for management UIs
- Pre-load campaign assignments
</Card>

<Card title="CDN and Asset Management" icon="cloud">
**Asset Storage:**
- CDN-optimize all creative assets
- Generate multiple image sizes automatically
- Implement lazy loading for asset libraries
- Use WebP/AVIF for modern browsers

**Caching Strategy:**
- Cache creative metadata (5min TTL)
- Cache campaign assignments (1min TTL) 
- Cache asset URLs indefinitely
- Invalidate on creative updates
</Card>

</CardGroup>

### API Integration Patterns

#### Bulk Operations Pattern

```typescript
// ❌ Inefficient: Multiple API calls
for (const creativeId of creativeIds) {
  await assignCreativeToGame(creativeId, campaignId);
}

// ✅ Efficient: Single bulk operation
await campaign/attach_creative({
  campaignId,
  buyerAgentId,  
  creativeIds: [...allCreativeIds]
});
```

#### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
// ✅ Production-ready error handling
try {
  const creative = await creative/create({...params});
  
  // Success: Continue workflow
  return { success: true, creativeId: creative.creativeId };
  
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === 'BUYER_AGENT_NOT_FOUND') {
    // Handle: Create buyer agent first
    await create_brand_agent({...});
    return retryCreativeCreation();
  }
  
  if (error.code === 'ASSET_UPLOAD_FAILED') {
    // Handle: Retry with different asset
    return fallbackAssetStrategy();
  }
  
  // Log and escalate unknown errors
  logger.error('Creative creation failed', error);
  throw error;
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Creative Library Management

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Naming Conventions">
**Strategic Naming for Scale:**

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Descriptive and searchable
creativeName: "Nike_Q1_2024_Spring_Collection_Hero_Video_v2"
creativeName: "Starbucks_Holiday_Banner_Desktop_1200x628_CTA_ShopNow"
creativeName: "Tesla_Model3_ProductDemo_Mobile_Native_Vertical"

// ❌ Bad: Generic and hard to find  
creativeName: "banner1"
creativeName: "video_final"
creativeName: "creative_v2"
```

**Benefits:**
- Fast creative discovery in large libraries
- Clear asset specifications for teams
- Version control for safe updates
- Campaign assignment clarity
</Tab>

<Tab title="Asset Organization">
**Library Structure:**

```typescript
// Organize by campaign tier
"Brand_Tier": Nike_Brand_Logo_2024_Primary.svg
"Campaign_Tier": Nike_Spring_Hero_Video_30s_1920x1080.mp4  
"Variant_Tier": Nike_Spring_CTA_ShopNow_v1.txt

// Tag for discovery
tags: ["brand_asset", "logo", "primary"]
tags: ["campaign_spring", "hero_video", "30_second"] 
tags: ["cta_button", "conversion", "variant_a"]
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Performance Monitoring">
**Key Metrics to Track:**

```typescript
// Creative performance KPIs
- CTR by creative (>2% is excellent)
- Conversion rate by creative
- Cost per conversion by creative
- Creative fatigue detection (CTR decline >20%)

// System performance KPIs  
- API response time (<100ms for creative/list)
- Asset load time (<2s for images, <5s for videos)
- Cache hit rate (>90% for management UIs)
- Error rate (<1% for all creative operations)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Enterprise Integration Patterns

### Multi-Brand Management

```typescript
// ✅ Proper multi-brand isolation
const brandAgents = [
  { name: "Nike", buyerAgentId: "ba_nike_123" },
  { name: "Adidas", buyerAgentId: "ba_adidas_456" },
  { name: "Puma", buyerAgentId: "ba_puma_789" }
];

// Each brand gets isolated creative library
for (const brand of brandAgents) {
  await creative/list({ buyerAgentId: brand.buyerAgentId });
}
```

### Creative Approval Workflows

```typescript
// Production approval flow
1. Create → status: "draft"
2. Review → status: "pending_review"  
3. Approve → status: "active"
4. Deploy → creative/assign to campaigns
5. Monitor → campaign/list_creatives for performance
6. Archive → status: "archived" (never delete)
```

### A/B Testing at Scale

```typescript
// Systematic A/B testing
const testCreatives = await creative/create({
  creativeName: "Holiday_Sale_Test_Variant_A",
  assets: [...variantAAssets]
});

const controlCreatives = await creative/create({
  creativeName: "Holiday_Sale_Test_Control", 
  assets: [...controlAssets]
});

// Split campaign assignment
await campaign/attach_creative({
  campaignId: "camp_test_A",
  creativeIds: [testCreatives.creativeId] 
});

await campaign/attach_creative({
  campaignId: "camp_control", 
  creativeIds: [controlCreatives.creativeId]
});

// Monitor and promote winner
const performanceA = await campaign/list_creatives({ campaignId: "camp_test_A" });
const performanceControl = await campaign/list_creatives({ campaignId: "camp_control" });

if (performanceA.ctr > performanceControl.ctr * 1.1) {
  // Scale winning creative to other campaigns
  await scaleWinnerToAllCampaigns(testCreatives.creativeId);
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Ignoring Creative Management

**Problem:** Attempting to run campaigns without proper creative management integration.

```typescript  
// ❌ This leads to poor performance
await create_campaign({
  name: "Summer Sale",
  budget: 50000
  // Missing: Creative integration
});
```

**Impact:** 
- 47% lower campaign performance
- 3x higher creative production costs
- Manual asset management overhead
- Brand inconsistency issues

**✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// Always integrate creative management
1. await create_brand_agent({ name: "Nike" });
2. await creative/create({ creativeName: "Summer Sale Creative", ... });
3. await create_campaign({ creativeIds: [...], ... });
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Poor Asset Organization

**Problem:** Generic naming and no tagging strategy.

```typescript
// ❌ Hard to manage at scale
creativeName: "banner1", "video_final", "image_v2"
```

**✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// Strategic naming and tagging
creativeName: "Nike_Q1_Spring_Hero_Banner_Desktop_1200x628_v1"
tags: ["nike", "q1", "spring", "hero", "banner", "desktop"]
```

---

### ❌ Anti-Pattern: Not Monitoring Performance

**Problem:** Creating creatives but not tracking their performance.

**✅ Solution:**
```typescript
// Regular performance analysis
const performance = await campaign/list_creatives({ 
  campaignId,
  includePerformance: true 
});

// Archive poor performers (CTR < 1%)
// Scale high performers (CTR > 3%)  
// Test variants of medium performers (CTR 1-3%)
```
