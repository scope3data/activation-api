<Warning>
**🚀 Alpha Release - Validation Testing Phase**

The Scope3 Campaign API is currently in **alpha status** as we conduct validation testing while the ADCP (Ad Campaign Data Protocol) specification continues to evolve. This means:

- Core functionality is stable and ready for testing
- API endpoints may change as the ADCP spec develops
- Documentation and examples are actively updated
- Feedback from early users helps shape the final product

**Perfect for:** Early adopters, testing environments, and pilot programs  
**Beta starts:** October 2025
