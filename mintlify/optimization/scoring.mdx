## Our Role in the Measurement Ecosystem

**We sit downstream from measurement processes.**

We don't measure whether ads worked. Instead, we normalize measurement data from various sources into a unified performance index that drives budget allocation.

## The Performance Index

### What We Normalize

We consume measurement outputs from:
- **Attribution platforms** (Google Analytics, Adobe)
- **Brand lift studies** (Nielsen, Kantar)
- **Media Mix Models** (MMM)
- **Conversion APIs** (Facebook, Google)
- **Custom measurement systems**

### The Unified Scale

All measurement data gets normalized to our performance index:

```
0 = No measurable value
100 = Meets defined objective
1000 = 10x target performance
```

This scale is **client-agnostic and campaign-dependent**. What these numbers represent varies completely:
- For one client, 100 might mean 2:1 ROAS
- For another, 100 might mean 5% brand lift
- For a third, 100 might mean $50 CPA

We don't know or need to know what the scores represent. They're just normalized proxies for optimization.

## How Normalization Works

### Step 1: Measurement Collection
Clients connect their measurement sources. Each source reports performance in its own units:
- MMM reports incremental sales
- Attribution reports conversion rates
- Brand studies report lift percentages

### Step 2: Client-Defined Objectives
The client defines what "success" means:
- Target ROAS of 3:1
- Brand awareness lift of 10%
- CPA under $75

### Step 3: Index Calculation
We normalize all measurements against objectives:
- Performance at target = 100
- Performance at 10x target = 1000
- No measurable value = 0

### Step 4: Tactic Scoring
Each tactic receives a performance index based on its contribution to measured outcomes.

## Source-Agnostic Optimization

The beauty of normalization: **we optimize without understanding.**

A tactic with index 200 gets more budget than one with index 50, regardless of whether those scores represent:
- ROAS vs brand lift
- Conversions vs video completions
- Sales vs site visits

The multi-armed bandit doesn't care what's being measured - it just allocates budget to higher-indexed tactics.

## Integration with Tactics

### Discovery Phase
New tactics start with no score. We allocate test budgets to establish baseline performance.

### Learning Phase
As measurement data arrives:
- Real-time signals update indices quickly
- Attribution data updates daily
- Brand studies update weekly/monthly

### Optimization Phase
The multi-armed bandit uses performance indices to:
- **Exploit**: Allocate more budget to high-index tactics
- **Explore**: Test new tactics that might beat current winners

## Measurement Lag Reality

Different measurement sources have different delays:

**Near Real-Time** (minutes to hours)
- Click tracking
- Video completions
- Landing page visits

**Daily** (1-7 days)
- Conversion tracking
- Attribution modeling
- CRM matching

**Weekly/Monthly** (7-30+ days)
- Brand lift studies
- MMM updates
- Offline sales matching

We handle this by maintaining provisional scores that update as more accurate measurement data arrives.

## What We Don't Do

To be absolutely clear:

- **We don't measure ad effectiveness** - measurement providers do
- **We don't calculate ROAS** - attribution platforms do
- **We don't determine brand lift** - research companies do
- **We don't define success** - clients do

We simply normalize whatever measurement data exists into a unified index for optimization.

## API Integration

### View Performance Indices

```javascript
const tactics = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  analysisType: "efficiency"
});

// Returns normalized performance indices
tactics.forEach(tactic => {
  console.log(`${tactic.name}: ${tactic.performanceIndex}`);
  console.log(`  Budget allocation: $${tactic.budgetShare}`);
  // Note: We don't know if index represents ROAS, lift, etc.
});
```

### Measurement Source Configuration

```javascript
// Client connects their measurement
const source = await addMeasurementSource({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  type: "attribution",
  platform: "google_analytics",
  // Client defines what "100" means for them
  targetMetric: "roas",
  targetValue: 3.5
});
```

## Key Takeaways

- **We normalize, not measure** - Downstream from measurement providers
- **Client-agnostic indexing** - 100 means different things to different clients
- **Source-agnostic optimization** - Budget flows to higher indices regardless of what they represent
- **Performance proxy** - Indices are just numbers for optimization, not interpretable metrics
- **Unified scale** - 0 (no value) to 100 (target) to 1000 (10x target)
