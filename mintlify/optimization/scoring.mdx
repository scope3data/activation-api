## The Three Scoring Components

**Tactic optimization uses three distinct scores combined with user-defined weights.**

Instead, you provide normalized outcome scores while Scope3 calculates quality and story affinity scores. The platform uses a weighted formula to determine which tactics get more budget.

## Scoring Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. Quality Score (Scope3-Provided)

**Media quality metrics assessed by Scope3:**
- **Impression quality**: Valid ad serving and visibility
- **View metrics**: Actual human viewability rates
- **Attention score**: User engagement and interaction depth
- **Completion rates**: Video/audio content completion percentages
- **IVT detection**: Invalid traffic and fraud prevention

Scale: 0-100 where 100 represents premium media quality.

### 2. Outcome Score (User-Provided)

**Your normalized downstream measurement data:**

You provide scores on the standard scale:
- **0** = No measurable value
- **100** = Meets defined objective
- **1000** = 10x target performance

**What you measure is up to you:**
- ROAS from attribution platforms
- Brand lift from research studies
- Conversion rates from your CRM
- Any KPI that matters to your business

**Critical**: You define the normalization, not us. We just use your scores.

### 3. Story Affinity Score (Scope3-Provided)

**How well tactics align with your selected brand stories:**
- Uses the brand stories you've created and selected for the campaign
- Assesses tactic performance against audience profiles you defined
- Measures how effectively tactics reach your intended brand narrative

Scale: 0-100 where 100 represents perfect alignment with your brand stories.

<Note>
Story Affinity requires you to have created and assigned brand stories to your campaign. Without brand stories, this component will be 0.
</Note>

## The Weighted Formula

**Campaign reward calculation:**
```
Tactic Reward = (a × Quality Score) + (b × Outcome Score) + (c × Story Affinity Score)
```

Where `a`, `b`, and `c` are weights you configure (must sum to 1.0).

### Example Weight Configurations

**Performance-Focused Campaign** (prioritize conversions)
```
Quality Weight: 0.2
Outcome Weight: 0.7  ← Emphasize your measurement results
Story Affinity Weight: 0.1
```

**Brand-Safe Premium Campaign** (prioritize quality inventory)
```
Quality Weight: 0.6  ← Emphasize media quality
Outcome Weight: 0.2
Story Affinity Weight: 0.2
```

**Brand Narrative Campaign** (align with brand stories)
```
Quality Weight: 0.3
Outcome Weight: 0.2
Story Affinity Weight: 0.5  ← Emphasize story alignment
```

## Outcome Score Window Days

**Critical for RL Algorithm Performance**

You must specify how many days before your outcome scores are available:
- **Immediate data** (same day): 0-1 days
- **Attribution data** (conversion tracking): 1-7 days  
- **Brand studies** (lift measurement): 7-30 days
- **MMM data** (incrementality): 30+ days

**Why this matters:** The RL algorithm won't penalize tactics for "poor performance" before outcome data arrives. Without proper window configuration, tactics get incorrectly downgraded.

## Campaign Configuration

### Setting Up Scoring

```javascript
const campaign = await createCampaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Q4 Performance Campaign",
  prompt: "Target high-value customers with premium inventory",
  
  // Configure the three-component scoring
  scoringWeights: {
    quality: 0.2,      // 20% media quality
    outcome: 0.7,      // 70% your measurement results  
    affinity: 0.1      // 10% brand story alignment
  },
  
  // Tell algorithm when your outcome data arrives
  outcomeScoreWindowDays: 7,  // Conversion data available after 7 days
  
  budget: { total: 50000, currency: "USD" }
});
```

### Providing Outcome Scores

```javascript
// You send normalized scores via your measurement integration
await updateTacticOutcomeScore({
  tacticId: "tactic_456",
  outcomeScore: 150,  // 1.5x your target performance
  timestamp: "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
});
```

## How Scores Drive Optimization

### Discovery Phase
- New tactics start with Quality and Affinity scores immediately
- Outcome scores remain at 0 until your measurement data arrives
- Budget allocation uses only Quality + Affinity during window period

### Learning Phase
- As your outcome scores arrive, they're incorporated into the weighted formula
- Multi-armed bandit adjusts based on complete scoring picture
- Tactics with high combined scores get more budget

### Optimization Phase
- All three components inform budget allocation decisions
- Your weighting determines which factors matter most
- Platform optimizes for your specific definition of success

## Common Weight Strategies

### E-commerce/Performance
Focus on conversion results:
```
Quality: 0.1, Outcome: 0.8, Affinity: 0.1
```

### Brand Building
Balance quality and story alignment:
```
Quality: 0.4, Outcome: 0.2, Affinity: 0.4  
```

### Premium/Luxury
Prioritize quality inventory:
```
Quality: 0.6, Outcome: 0.3, Affinity: 0.1
```

### Audience Development
Test story affinity effectiveness:
```
Quality: 0.2, Outcome: 0.3, Affinity: 0.5
```

## Key Concepts

### You Control What "Success" Means

- **Quality Score**: We assess media quality
- **Outcome Score**: You define and provide success metrics
- **Story Affinity**: We measure against your selected brand stories
- **Weights**: You determine the importance of each component

### Window Days Are Critical

Set `outcomeScoreWindowDays` accurately:
- Too short = penalize tactics before data arrives
- Too long = delay optimization decisions
- Match your actual measurement lag for best results

### Weights Must Sum to 1.0

The platform validates that quality + outcome + affinity weights = 1.0. This ensures consistent scoring across campaigns.

## The Bottom Line

- **Three distinct scoring components** with different data sources
- **You provide normalized outcome scores** based on your measurement
- **Weighted formula combines all three** according to your priorities  
- **Outcome window prevents premature penalization** of tactics
- **Your weights determine optimization behavior** - not our assumptions
