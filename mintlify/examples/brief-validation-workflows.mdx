## Overview

This guide provides practical examples of how to use the campaign brief validation system effectively in different scenarios. Each workflow demonstrates best practices for ensuring high-quality campaigns while optimizing for efficiency and carbon impact.

<Tip>
**Carbon-Conscious Development**

The recommended "validate first, create second" workflow saves processing time and reduces carbon footprint by avoiding duplicate AI evaluations. Always validate briefs separately when iterating on quality.
</Tip>

## Workflow 1: Comprehensive Brief Development

**Use Case:** Developing a high-quality campaign brief from scratch with iterative improvement.

### Step 1: Initial Brief Validation

```javascript
// Start with your initial brief draft
{
  "brief": "Launch Nike athletic wear campaign for young fitness enthusiasts. Focus on major cities and use video content. Target good engagement rates.",
  "threshold": 70
}
```

**Response - Low Quality Score:**
```json
{
  "score": 35,
  "meetsThreshold": false,
  "qualityLevel": "Minimal Brief",
  "missingElements": [
    "Geographic targeting not defined - CRITICAL for inventory matching",
    "Campaign flight dates not specified - CRITICAL for inventory availability", 
    "Creative format requirements not defined - CRITICAL for inventory matching",
    "Success metrics not defined",
    "Target audience not specific enough"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Specify exact cities or metro areas (e.g., 'NYC, LA, Chicago metro areas')",
    "Include campaign start/end dates or duration",
    "Define video specifications (15s/30s for CTV, aspect ratios, etc.)",
    "Set measurable KPI targets (CTR, impressions, completion rates)",
    "Detail demographics beyond 'young fitness enthusiasts'"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Improved Brief Based on Feedback

```javascript
{
  "brief": "Launch Nike athletic wear campaign targeting fitness enthusiasts 25-35 with household income $50k+ in tier 1 US cities (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF metro areas). Campaign runs March 1 - May 31, 2025. Objectives: Achieve 25% brand awareness lift and 20M impressions. Success metrics: 2.8% CTR target, 35% video completion rate. Creative requirements: 15s/30s video ads for CTV plus 300x250 and 728x90 display banners. Focus on sustainability messaging.",
  "threshold": 70
}
```

**Response - High Quality Score:**
```json
{
  "score": 88,
  "meetsThreshold": true,
  "qualityLevel": "Comprehensive Brief",
  "missingElements": [],
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider specifying daily budget caps for pacing control",
    "Add competitive separation requirements for premium placements"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Campaign Creation with Skip Validation

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_nike_123",
  "name": "Nike Spring Athletic Campaign 2025",
  "prompt": "Launch Nike athletic wear campaign targeting fitness enthusiasts 25-35 with household income $50k+ in tier 1 US cities (NYC, LA, Chicago, SF metro areas)...",
  "budget": {
    "total": 25000000,  // $250,000
    "dailyCap": 1200000,  // $12,000/day
    "pacing": "even"
  },
  "startDate": "2025-03-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-05-31T23:59:59Z",
  "skipBriefValidation": true  // Already validated separately
}
```

<Note>
**Efficiency Benefit**: By validating first and then creating with `skipBriefValidation: true`, you avoid duplicate AI processing, saving time and reducing carbon impact.
</Note>

## Workflow 2: Direct Campaign Creation with Retry

**Use Case:** Quick campaign creation when you're confident in your brief quality, with fallback handling.

### Step 1: Direct Campaign Creation Attempt

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_adidas_456", 
  "name": "Adidas Summer Running Campaign",
  "prompt": "Summer running campaign for active lifestyle enthusiasts. Focus on performance and comfort messaging with engaging creative content.",
  "budget": {
    "total": 10000000,  // $100,000
    "pacing": "accelerated"
  }
}
```

**Response - Validation Failure:**
```text
❌ Campaign Creation Failed - Brief Quality Below Threshold

**Score:** 42/100 (Required: 70/100)
**Quality Level:** Minimal Brief

**Missing Critical Elements:**
• Geographic targeting not defined - CRITICAL for inventory matching
• Campaign flight dates not specified - CRITICAL for inventory availability  
• Creative format requirements not defined - CRITICAL for inventory matching
• Success metrics not defined

**Suggestions to Improve:**
• Specify target locations (e.g., 'tier 1 US cities', 'NYC, LA, Chicago metro areas')
• Include campaign timing (e.g., 'March 1 - April 15, 2025')
• Define creative formats needed (video specs, display sizes, etc.)
• Set measurable KPI targets (CTR, impressions, completion rates)

**Options:**
• Improve the brief based on suggestions above and try again
• Use campaign_validate_brief tool to check quality before creation
• Set skipBriefValidation: true to bypass validation (not recommended)
```

### Step 2: Improved Brief and Retry

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_adidas_456",
  "name": "Adidas Summer Running Campaign", 
  "prompt": "Summer running campaign targeting active adults 25-45 in warm-weather US markets (California, Texas, Florida, Arizona metro areas). Campaign runs June 1 - August 31, 2025 during peak running season. Objectives: Drive 15% increase in online sales and 12M impressions. Success metrics: 3.2% CTR, 8% conversion rate from clicks. Creative requirements: 15s/30s video for digital/CTV, 320x50 mobile banners, 300x250 display units. Focus on performance and comfort messaging.",
  "budget": {
    "total": 10000000,  // $100,000
    "pacing": "accelerated"
  },
  "startDate": "2025-06-01T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-08-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```

**Response - Successful Creation:**
```text
✅ Campaign Created Successfully!

**Brief Validation Results:**
• Quality Score: 82/100 ✅
• Quality Level: Comprehensive Brief

**Campaign Details:**
• ID: camp_adidas_789
• Name: Adidas Summer Running Campaign
• Status: active
• Created: 2024-12-01 10:30:00
```

## Workflow 3: Premium Campaign with High Standards

**Use Case:** Creating a high-budget campaign that requires exceptional brief quality.

### Step 1: Validation with High Threshold

```javascript
{
  "brief": "Launch premium Tesla Model S campaign targeting affluent professionals 35-55 with household income $150k+ in luxury markets (Manhattan, Beverly Hills, Palo Alto, Georgetown). Campaign runs during Q1 2025 earnings season (January 15 - March 31). Objectives: Generate 500 qualified test drive leads and achieve 45% brand consideration lift among luxury car shoppers. Success metrics: 4.5% CTR, 2% lead conversion rate, 60% video completion rate for 30s spots. Creative requirements: Premium 30s/60s video content for CTV/YouTube, high-impact 970x250 display units, native content integration. Budget $500k with sophisticated pacing algorithms and premium inventory prioritization.",
  "threshold": 85,  // Higher standard for premium campaign
  "brandAgentId": "agent_tesla_premium"
}
```

**Response - Exceeds High Standards:**
```json
{
  "score": 92,
  "meetsThreshold": true,
  "qualityLevel": "Comprehensive Brief",
  "feedback": "Exceptional brief quality with comprehensive targeting, clear premium positioning, and detailed specifications that enable optimal inventory matching for luxury automotive campaigns.",
  "suggestions": [
    "Consider adding competitive exclusion requirements for adjacent automotive ads",
    "Specify premium publisher whitelist for brand alignment"
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Premium Campaign Creation

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_tesla_premium",
  "name": "Tesla Model S Q1 Premium Campaign",
  "prompt": "Launch premium Tesla Model S campaign targeting affluent professionals 35-55...",
  "budget": {
    "total": 50000000,  // $500,000
    "currency": "USD",
    "dailyCap": 2500000,  // $25,000/day
    "pacing": "front_loaded"  // Aggressive early delivery
  },
  "startDate": "2025-01-15T00:00:00Z",
  "endDate": "2025-03-31T23:59:59Z",
  "skipBriefValidation": true,  // Pre-validated at high threshold
  "creativeIds": ["creative_tesla_premium_video", "creative_tesla_display"]
}
```

## Workflow 4: Rapid Campaign Development

**Use Case:** Multiple campaigns need to be created quickly with consistent quality standards.

### Step 1: Validate Multiple Brief Variations

```javascript
// Validate Campaign A
{
  "brief": "Back-to-school Apple iPad campaign for students 16-24 and parents 35-50 in college towns nationwide. August 1 - September 15, 2025. Target 18M impressions with 2.1% CTR. Use 15s video and 300x250 banners emphasizing productivity.",
  "threshold": 70
}

// Validate Campaign B  
{
  "brief": "Holiday Apple AirPods campaign targeting music lovers 18-35 in major US cities. November 15 - December 24, 2025. Target 25M impressions with 2.8% CTR. Use 30s video and native content for discovery.",
  "threshold": 70
}
```

### Step 2: Batch Campaign Creation

```javascript
// Create Campaign A (validated separately)
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_apple_education",
  "name": "iPad Back-to-School 2025",
  "prompt": "Back-to-school Apple iPad campaign for students 16-24...",
  "skipBriefValidation": true
}

// Create Campaign B (validated separately)
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_apple_consumer", 
  "name": "AirPods Holiday 2025",
  "prompt": "Holiday Apple AirPods campaign targeting music lovers...",
  "skipBriefValidation": true
}
```

## Workflow 5: Handling Edge Cases

### Low-Quality Brief with Business Override

Sometimes business requirements necessitate launching with incomplete briefs:

```javascript
{
  "brandAgentId": "agent_startup_123",
  "name": "Emergency Brand Response Campaign",
  "prompt": "Urgent campaign to address recent market developments. Target broad audience with flexible messaging. Launch ASAP.",
  "budget": { "total": 500000 },  // $5,000 emergency budget
  "skipBriefValidation": true  // Override quality gate for urgency
}
```

<Warning>
**Business Risk**: Campaigns with incomplete briefs may struggle to find appropriate inventory or achieve desired outcomes. Use this override judiciously and plan to iterate quickly based on early performance data.
</Warning>

### Testing Brief Quality Improvements

```javascript
// Test different threshold levels to understand brief quality
{
  "brief": "Your campaign brief content here...",
  "threshold": 50  // Lower threshold to understand baseline quality
}

// Then test with standard threshold
{
  "brief": "Same brief content...",
  "threshold": 70  // Standard threshold
}

// Finally test with premium threshold
{
  "brief": "Same brief content...",
  "threshold": 85  // Premium threshold
}
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

<Warning>
**❌ Don't Do This**

- Creating campaigns without validating briefs first
- Using generic descriptions like "young people" or "major markets"  
- Omitting flight dates or geographic targeting
- Forgetting creative format specifications
- Setting unrealistic quality thresholds that block all campaigns
</Warning>

<Tip>
**✅ Do This Instead**

- Validate briefs iteratively and improve based on AI feedback
- Use specific, measurable language for all requirements
- Always include the 6 critical elements publishers need
- Test different threshold levels to find the right balance
- Skip validation on pre-validated briefs to save resources
</Tip>
