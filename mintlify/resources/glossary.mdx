## Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agentic Campaign Management">
    **Definition:** A campaign management approach where AI agents handle
    complex advertising operations through natural language instructions rather
    than manual configuration. **How it works:** Instead of filling out forms
    with targeting parameters, you describe your campaign goals in plain
    English, and AI agents automatically configure targeting, bidding, creative
    optimization, and performance management. **Example:** "Target young
    professionals interested in sustainable products with a $10K budget" becomes
    a fully configured campaign with audience targeting, bidding strategy, and
    optimization rules.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="AI-Powered Optimization">
  **Definition:** Continuous campaign improvement using machine learning
  algorithms that automatically adjust targeting, bidding, creative delivery,
  and budget allocation based on real-time performance data. **Key features:** -
  Real-time bid optimization - Automatic audience expansion/contraction -
  Creative performance testing and rotation - Budget reallocation across
  high-performing segments - Cross-campaign learning and optimization
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Natural Language Prompts">
    **Definition:** Human-readable descriptions of campaign objectives that get
    automatically converted into technical advertising configurations. **Best
    practices:** - Be specific about your target audience - Include business
    objectives and success metrics - Mention geographic, demographic, or
    interest constraints - Specify budget and timing requirements - Use business
    language, not technical parameters
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account & Organization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Brand Agent">
    **Definition:** The top-level container in Scope3 that holds all your
    advertising assets and configurations. Equivalent to an Advertiser account
    in traditional DSPs. **Platform equivalents:** - **TTD:** Advertiser -

    Account **Contains:** - Campaigns (budget allocation units) - Creatives
    (shared asset library) - Synthetic Audiences (targeting profiles) - Brand
    Standards (safety rules) - Measurement Sources (analytics integration)

    assets, and brand safety settings.

    agents under a single organization or client. **Use cases:** - Agency
