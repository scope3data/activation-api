</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Performance Optimization" icon="chart-line">

AI optimizes creatives based on performance data:

```python
# Performance-Driven Optimization
if creative.ctr < campaign.average_ctr:
    agent.suggest_improvements([
        "Try brighter colors for better attention",
        "Shorten headline for mobile readability", 
        "Test video format for higher engagement"
    ])

if creative.conversion_rate > campaign.top_performers:
    agent.create_variants([
        "Similar style for other products",
        "Seasonal variations of successful design",
        "Cross-format adaptations"
    ])
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dynamic Personalization" icon="user-gear">

Code mode enables real-time creative adaptation:

```javascript
// Dynamic Creative Logic
const personalizeCreative = (user, context) => {
  const creative = baseTemplate.clone();
  
  // Location-based personalization
  if (user.location.weather === 'cold') {
    creative.headline = "Warm Up with Hot Coffee";
    creative.image = warmCoffeeImage;
  }
  
  // Time-based personalization  
  if (context.hour < 10) {
    creative.offer = "Morning Special: 20% Off";
  }
  
  // Behavioral personalization
  if (user.previousPurchases.includes('premium')) {
    creative.product = premiumBlend;
  }
  
  return creative;
};
```

</Accordion>
