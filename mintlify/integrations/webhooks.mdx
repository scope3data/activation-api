## What are Webhooks?

Webhooks send instant notifications to your team when important things happen with your campaigns - like budget alerts, performance drops, or campaign completion.

Think of them like text message alerts for your advertising campaigns.

## Setting Up Webhooks

The easiest way to set up webhooks is through your Scope3 dashboard:

1. **Log into [Scope3](https://app.scope3.com)**
2. **Go to Campaign Settings** â†’ **Notifications**
3. **Choose where to send alerts:**
   - Slack channel
   - Email address  
   - Custom webhook URL

## Common Alert Types

### Budget Alerts
- Daily spend exceeds your limit
- Campaign is spending too fast or too slow
- Budget is nearly depleted

### Performance Alerts  
- Click-through rate drops significantly
- Cost per impression increases beyond threshold
- Video completion rate declines

### Status Changes
- Campaign automatically paused
- Campaign completed successfully
- New creatives approved and live

## Popular Integrations

### Slack
Get campaign alerts directly in your team's Slack channel:

```
ðŸš¨ Budget Alert: Nike Air Max Campaign
ðŸ’° Daily spend: $3,247 (exceeded $2,500 limit by 30%)
ðŸ”§ Action needed: Review budget or pause campaign
ðŸ“Š View campaign: https://app.scope3.com/campaigns/123
```

### Email
Receive formatted email alerts with campaign details and quick action links.

### Custom Webhooks
For developers: receive JSON payloads at your own API endpoints for custom integrations.

## Simple Custom Integration

If you want to receive webhooks at your own URL, here's a basic example:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Simple Webhook Handler
// Basic webhook receiver
app.post('/webhooks/scope3', (req, res) => {
  const alert = req.body;
  
  console.log(`Campaign Alert: ${alert.campaignId}`);
  console.log(`Issue: ${alert.message}`);
  console.log(`Severity: ${alert.severity}`);
  
  // Send to your team's notification system
  notifyTeam(alert);
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

```python Python Handler
from flask import Flask, request

@app.route('/webhooks/scope3', methods=['POST'])
def handle_alert():
    alert = request.json
    
    print(f"Campaign Alert: {alert['campaignId']}")
    print(f"Issue: {alert['message']}")
    
    # Send to your notification system
    send_team_notification(alert)
    
    return 'OK', 200
```

</CodeGroup>

## Example Webhook Payload

When something happens with your campaign, you'll receive a simple JSON payload:

```json
{
  "campaignId": "camp_airmax_123",
  "campaignName": "Nike Air Max Q1 Launch", 
  "alertType": "budget_exceeded",
  "severity": "warning",
  "message": "Daily spend exceeded $2,500 limit by 30%",
  "currentValue": "$3,247",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z",
  "actionUrl": "https://app.scope3.com/campaigns/camp_airmax_123"
}
```

## Getting Started

1. **Start simple**: Set up Slack or email notifications in your Scope3 dashboard
2. **Test with a campaign**: Create a test campaign with low budget thresholds to see how alerts work
3. **Customize later**: If needed, set up custom webhook endpoints for advanced integrations
