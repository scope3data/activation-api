## Overview

Sales agents provide access to advertising inventory through the ADCP protocol. They represent various types of sellers: publishers, ad networks, sales houses, and other inventory sources.

## How It Works

By default, you have access to inventory through Scope3's relationships with sales agents. You can optionally register your own accounts with sales agents for:

- **Direct billing** - Pay the sales agent directly (Scope3 charges less for direct connections)
- **Your negotiated terms** - Use your existing relationships and rates
- **Additional inventory** - Access sales agents that Scope3 doesn't have relationships with

### Account Precedence

When you discover products, the system automatically:
1. **Your accounts** - Uses your registered sales agent accounts
2. **Scope3 accounts** - Falls back to Scope3's relationships 
3. **Unavailable** - Skips agents with no available accounts

## Managing Your Sales Agents

### List Available Agents

*Agent*:
Call tool `sales_agents_list` with body:
```json
{}
```

Shows all sales agents with account status:
- ‚úÖ **Your account** - You have a direct relationship
- üè¢ **Scope3 account** - Available through Scope3's relationship
- ‚ùå **Unavailable** - No accounts registered

### Register Your Account

If you have a direct relationship with a sales agent:

*Agent*:
Call tool `sales_agents_register` with body:
```json
{
  "name": "Scribd Sales",
  "endpoint_url": "https://ads.scribd.com/adcp",
  "account_identifier": "your-account-id",
  "auth_config": {
    "api_key": "your_scribd_api_key"
  }
}
```

### Update Your Account

*Agent*:
Call tool `sales_agents_update` with body:
```json
{
  "sales_agent_id": "agent_123",
  "account_identifier": "new-account-id"
}
```

### Unregister Account

*Agent*:
Call tool `sales_agents_unregister` with body:
```json
{
  "sales_agent_id": "agent_123",
  "confirm": true
}
```

## Using Sales Agents in Campaigns

Sales agents are automatically used for product discovery:

*Agent*:
Call tool `tactic_discover_products` with body:
```json
{
  "campaignBrief": "Premium coffee brand inventory"
}
```

**What happens behind the scenes:**
1. Scope3 identifies available sales agents (your accounts + Scope3 accounts)
2. Scope3 sends ADCP `get-products` calls to each sales agent via MCP/A-to-A protocol
3. Each sales agent responds with their available inventory through the ADCP protocol
4. Scope3 combines and ranks the results

<Info>
ADCP uses MCP (Model Context Protocol) or A-to-A (Agent-to-Agent) communication, not REST APIs. For technical details, see the [official ADCP documentation](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/media-buy/).
</Info>

To use specific sales agents only:

*Agent*:
Call tool `tactic_discover_products` with body:
```json
{
  "campaignBrief": "Coffee brands",
  "salesAgents": ["scribd_sales", "pubmatic_direct"]
}
```

## Important Notes

<Warning>
When you use your own sales agent account, you are responsible for payments directly with that sales agent. Scope3 is not involved in the financial relationship.
</Warning>

<Info>
If you register a sales agent that Scope3 doesn't have a relationship with, Scope3 cannot provide technical support or guarantees for that integration.
</Info>

## Adding New Sales Agents

If you work with a sales agent not in our system, you can add them:

*Agent*:
Call tool `sales_agents_register` with body:
```json
{
  "name": "New Sales House",
  "endpoint_url": "https://newsaleshouse.com/adcp",
  "description": "Premium lifestyle inventory",
  "auth_config": {
    "api_key": "your_api_key_for_new_sales_house"
  }
}
```

This creates the sales agent in the global registry and registers your account with them.

## Next Steps

- Use `tactic_discover_products` to find inventory across your available sales agents
- Set up [campaigns](/object-guides/campaign) using discovered products
- Monitor performance through [reporting](/reporting-overview)
