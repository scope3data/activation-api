# AXE Integration

AXE (Agentic eXchange Engine) is Scope3's real-time data and optimization platform that enables AI buyer agents to make intelligent bidding decisions. This guide covers technical integration for various ad server combinations.

## Overview

Scope3 expects an OpenRTB-compatible request and returns a list of segments for inclusion, exclusion, and macros. These segments should be passed into the ad server for targeting.

This integration can happen client-side (typically through Prebid) or server-side (which requires development work). For server-side integration, please contact Scope3 to discuss technical requirements.

### Decide on AXE Key Names

Scope3 will use these default key names:

- `axei` - Inclusion segments (1P audience matching)
- `axex` - Exclusion segments (brand safety blocks)
- `axem` - Creative macros

If you want Scope3 to return different key names, please change them at Settings->AXE once you log into your Scope3.com account.

### Prebid.js Implementation

#### Install Scope3 AXE Module in Prebid

Scope3 was added to Prebid in [version 10.9.0](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/releases/tag/10.9.0).

If building Prebid.js from source, include the Scope3 RTD module:

```bash
gulp build --modules=scope3RtdProvider,bidAdapter1,bidAdapter2,...
```

If you're using the pre-built package from prebid.org, make sure the Scope3 module is included in your build.

#### Configuration

Add the Scope3 RTD provider to your Prebid configuration using this config snippet:

```javascript
pbjs.setConfig({
    realTimeData: {
      auctionDelay: 100,
      dataProviders: [{
        name: 'scope3',
        params: {
          orgId: 'XXXXXX', // put your org ID here
          timeout: 100, // max time to wait for response
          debugMode: false // set to true for testing
        }
      }]
    }
  });
```

### Prebid Server Implementation

Add the Scope3 Prebid Server module to your Prebid Server setup and add the config snippet to your configuration file.

(Scope3 todo: add a full example here)

### Server-to-server Implementation

See [Scope3 RTD Documentation](https://docs.scope3.com/docs/signals-integrations#/)

### Testing and Validation

For testing purposes, Scope3 will send a test segment until live segments are available (should be `test-dnu` or something similar)

### Check that AXE Segments are flowing into Prebid

1. Open your browser's developer tools
2. Navigate to a page with ads
3. Look for Scope3 RTD activity in the console
4. Verify segments are being passed through Prebid into the ad server
