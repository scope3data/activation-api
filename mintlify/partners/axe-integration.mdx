# AXE Integration

AXE (Agentic eXchange Engine) is Scope3's real-time data and optimization platform that enables AI buyer agents to make intelligent bidding decisions. This guide covers technical integration for various ad server combinations.

## Overview

Scope3 expects an OpenRTB-compatible request and returns a list of segments for inclusion, exclusion, and macros. These segments should be passed into the ad server for targeting.

This integration can happen client-side (typically through Prebid) or server-side (which requires development work). For server-side integration, please contact Scope3 to discuss technical requirements.

### Decide on AXE Key Names

Scope3 will use these default key names:

- `axei` - Inclusion segments (1P audience matching)
- `axex` - Exclusion segments (brand safety blocks)
- `axem` - Creative macros

If you want Scope3 to return different key names, please change them at Settings->AXE once you log into your Scope3.com account.

### Prebid.js Implementation

#### Install Scope3 AXE Module in Prebid

If building Prebid.js from source, include the Scope3 RTD module:

```bash
gulp build --modules=scope3RtdProvider,bidAdapter1,bidAdapter2,...
```

If you're using the pre-built package from prebid.org, make sure the Scope3 module is included in your build.

#### Configuration

Go to Settings-AXE in your Scope3.com account. Select "Prebid.js" and get the config snippet.

Add the Scope3 RTD provider to your Prebid configuration using this config snippet:

```javascript
pbjs.setConfig({
  realTimeData: {
    auctionDelay: 100,
    dataProviders: [{
      name: "scope3",
      waitForIt: true,
      params: {
        // Configuration provided by Scope3 team
        publisherId: "YOUR_PUBLISHER_ID",
        // Additional parameters provided during setup
      }
    }]
  }
});
```

### Prebid Server Implementation

Go to Settings-AXE in your Scope3.com account. Select "Prebid Server" and get the config snippet.

Add the Scope3 Prebid Server module to your Prebid Server setup and add the config snippet to your configuration file.

(Scope3 todo: add a full example here)

### Server-to-server Implementation

See [Scope3 RTD Documentation](https://docs.scope3.com/docs/signals-integrations#/)

### Testing and Validation

For testing purposes, Scope3 will send a test segment until live segments are available (should be `test-dnu` or something similar)

### Check that AXE Segments are flowing into Prebid

1. Open your browser's developer tools
2. Navigate to a page with ads
3. Look for Scope3 RTD activity in the console
4. Verify segments are being passed through Prebid into the ad server
