## Overview

To integrate your ad network with Scope3, you need to build an ADCP (Ad Context Protocol) sales agent that implements the MCP (Model Context Protocol) or A-to-A (Agent-to-Agent) communication standards.

## Technical Requirements

### ADCP Implementation

ADCP uses MCP/A-to-A protocols, not REST APIs. For complete technical specifications and implementation guides:

- **ðŸ“– Official ADCP Documentation**: [https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/media-buy/](https://adcontextprotocol.org/docs/media-buy/)
- **ðŸ’¬ ADCP Slack Community**: [Join here](https://join.slack.com/t/agenticads/shared_invite/zt-3c5sxvdjk-x0rVmLB3OFHVUp~WutVWZg)

### Core Capabilities Your Sales Agent Needs

Your ADCP sales agent must implement:

- **Product Discovery** - Respond to inventory requests with available products
- **Availability Checking** - Confirm inventory availability in real-time
- **Reservation/Booking** - Handle campaign reservations and bookings
- **Pricing** - Provide dynamic pricing based on inventory and demand

## Getting Listed in Scope3

Once your ADCP sales agent is built and tested:

1. **Test Your Integration**
   - Use the ADCP test tools in the official documentation
   - Validate with the ADCP community in Slack

2. **Register with Scope3**
