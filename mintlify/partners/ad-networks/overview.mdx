## Overview

Ad networks, SSPs, and sales houses can connect to Scope3 to provide programmatic access to their inventory through the ADCP protocol.

## Integration Requirements

### Technical Integration

From a technical perspective, you need:

- **ADCP Sales Agent** - Built on top of your ad server and technical infrastructure to provide inventory access
- **Ad Server Capabilities** - Ability to traffic campaigns, set up creatives, and provide reporting
- **Real-time Scope3 Integration** - Connect to Scope3's real-time data provider (multiple integration options available)

### Commercial Integration  

From a business perspective, you need to consider:

- **Billing and Payments** - How you handle direct customer billing
- **Product Packaging** - How you structure and price your inventory offerings
- **Terms and Agreements** - Commercial relationships with advertisers

## Key Differences from Publishers

Ad networks differ from direct publishers because they:

- **Aggregate Multiple Sources** - Represent inventory from many publishers or sources
- **Manage Yield** - Dynamic pricing and inventory allocation
- **Handle Billing** - Direct financial relationships with advertisers
- **Provide Technical Delivery** - Ad serving across multiple publisher sites
- **Proprietary Capabilities** - May have proprietary audiences, custom algorithms, and provide measurement services

## Getting Started

1. [Set up your sales agent](/partners/ad-networks/sales-agent-setup)
2. Test with sandbox campaigns
3. Get listed in the global registry

## Revenue Opportunity

Integrating as a sales agent provides:

- **Automated Discovery** - Reduce manual RFP processing
- **New Customer Access** - Reach Scope3's advertiser base
- **Higher Budgets** - Agentic campaigns often have premium budgets
