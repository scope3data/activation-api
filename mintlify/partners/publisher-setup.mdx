# Publisher Setup

Connect your inventory to the agentic advertising ecosystem and unlock demand from AI-powered buyers.

## Overview

**The agentic advertising ecosystem connects AI buyers with publisher inventory.** Scope3 is an agentic buyer platform - we have buying agents that represent our clients and make real-time purchasing decisions.

Here's how it works for publishers:

**You need a sales agent.** Sales agents are how agentic buyers get information about your inventory and place orders. Think of them as the interface between your ad server and the agentic buyers.

**For Scope3 specifically, you also need AXE.** AXE (Agentic eXchange Engine) is our real-time decisioning service that connects into your ad server. It provides the targeting data and signals that enable our buying agents to make intelligent decisions about your inventory.

**Your sales agent might handle AXE for you.** Some sales agent partners already integrate AXE as part of their service, so you might not need to do any additional technical setup.

## Why Connect to Agentic Buyers?

Connecting to the agentic ecosystem unlocks efficiency and control that aren't possible in either direct sales or programmatic independently - it's the best of both worlds:

- **Direct access to demand**: No need for layers of intermediaries: Buying agents send demand directly
- **No fancy tech**: Demand is trafficked as line items in your ad server
- **Feedback loop**: No guessing why an advertiser didn't bid
- **Accelerate operations**: Let AI take the manual steps out of operations
- **Control**: You decide how campaigns are trafficked

### Step 3: Integrate AXE with your ad stack

Whether you need to integrate AXE depends on your sales agent choice:

- **Some sales agents handle everything** - AXE integration is already included in their service
- **Other setups require additional work** - You'll need to integrate AXE with your ad server

**ðŸ‘‰ If your sales agent requires additional AXE setup, see the [AXE Integration guide](/mintlify/partners/axe-integration).**

## Next Steps: Optimize Your Ad Products

Once your technical integration is complete, the key to success is structuring your inventory as discoverable products that buying agents can understand and test.

**ðŸ‘‰ See [Designing Ad Products](/mintlify/partners/designing-ad-products)** to learn how to:
- Package inventory into testable products
- Write descriptions that AI agents can understand
- Set pricing strategies that maximize revenue
- Support consistent daily spend requirements

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does publisher integration typically take?**
A: It depends on the sales agent and your ad stack, but generally a few hours to set up.

**Q: Is there a minimum inventory requirement?**
A: Agents will struggle to allocate campaigns to small publishers except in endemic situations. It may make sense to work with a sales house or aggregator to get started, then add a direct agent if there is significant demand.
