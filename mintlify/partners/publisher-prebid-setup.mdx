# Publisher Setup with Hosted Sales Agent

Complete guide to setting up a publisher as a Scope3 agentic destination using Prebid

<Steps>

<Step title="Prerequisites">
Before starting this integration, ensure you have:

- **Google Ad Manager (GAM)** account with administrative access
- **Scope3 account** with the Activation package enabled
- **Prebid.js 8.50.0+** or **Prebid Server (Go version)** implementation
- Access to modify your Prebid configuration files
</Step>

<Step title="AXE Integration">

[Set up AXE integration](/partners/axe-integration)

<Step title="Google Ad Manager Setup">

### Create Scope3 Advertiser

1. Navigate to **Inventory** → **Advertisers** in GAM
2. Click **New advertiser**
3. Set up the advertiser:
   - **Name**: "Scope3"
   - **Type**: "Advertiser"
   - Click **Save**

### Set Up Key-Value Targeting

1. Navigate to **Inventory** → **Key-values** in GAM
2. Create three new key-values using the names you chose in the AXE integration:

#### Inclusion Segments Key (`axei`)
- **Key name**: `axei` (or your custom name)
- **Values**: Dynamic (will be populated by Scope3)
- **Value type**: Freeform

#### Exclusion Segments Key (`axex`)
- **Key name**: `axex` (or your custom name)  
- **Values**: Dynamic (will be populated by Scope3)
- **Value type**: Freeform

#### Macros Key (`axem`)
- **Key name**: `axem` (or your custom name)
- **Values**: Dynamic (will be populated by Scope3)
- **Value type**: Freeform

</Step>

<Step title="Scope3 Account Configuration">

### Connect GAM Account

1. Navigate to **Integrations** → **Publishers**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Select **Google Ad Manager**
4. Complete OAuth authorization process
5. Grant necessary permissions when prompted

### Configure GAM integration
Once you connect GAM, Scope3 will load the advertisers from the GAM API.
* Select the Scope3 advertiser you selected from the list

You will now see the URL for your sales agent! It will show up as "Not authorized" until you do the next step (Authorize your sales agent).

### Add a custom domain (recommended)

See the instructions on the GAM integration page to set up a custom domain (for instance, ad-sales.your-domain.com) and to configure the landing page.

</Step>

<Step title="Authorize the sales agent">

Much like `ads.txt` for the programmatic world, agentic buyers look at `adgents.json` to see if a sales agent is authorized for a particular publisher.

(todo: add snippet once AdCP spec is finalized)

You should now see your sales agent show up as "Authorized".

</Step>
