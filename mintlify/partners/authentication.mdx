## Overview

Partners and agent integrations require authentication to access platform resources. This guide covers API key setup and seat access discovery for multi-seat management.

## API Key Setup

All API requests require an API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
**API Key Security:**
- Get your Scope3 API key: [Get one here](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys)
- Use HTTPS only - never send keys over HTTP
- Store keys securely and rotate regularly
- Each API key provides access to specific seats based on your partner configuration
</Warning>

## Discovering Accessible Seats

### Check Seat Access

**MCP Tool**: `signals/get-partner-seats`

Use this tool to discover which brand agent seats your API key can access:

```json
{
  "tool": "signals/get-partner-seats",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

**Response includes:**
- Seat ID and display name
- Brand agent information
- Access permissions and scope
- Last activity date

### Using Seat Information

Once you know which seats you can access, you can:

**Filter operations by seat:**
```json
{
  "tool": "signals/list",
  "parameters": {
    "seatId": "seat_abc123"
  }
}
```

**Access seat-specific resources:**
- Signals and segments
- Campaign data
- Performance metrics
- Configuration settings

## Authentication Scopes

Partner API keys provide different access levels:

### Read Access
- List accessible seats
- View segments and signals
- Read campaign performance data
- Access reporting APIs

### Write Access  
- Create and update segments
- Attach data to segments
- Register signals agents
- Modify campaign configurations

### Administrative Access
- Manage API key permissions
- Configure seat access controls
- Set up webhook endpoints
- Access audit logs

## Multi-Seat Operations

When working across multiple seats, operations automatically scope to your accessible seats:

**List all segments across seats:**
```json
{
  "tool": "signals/list",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

**Results include seat information:**
- `seatId` - Unique seat identifier
- `seatName` - Human-readable seat name  
- Standard resource metadata

This enables you to understand which seat owns each resource and manage targeting at the seat level.

## Error Handling

**Common authentication errors:**

### Invalid API Key
```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or expired API key"
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions
```json
{
  "error": "forbidden", 
  "message": "API key does not have access to requested seat"
}
```

### Seat Not Found
```json
{
  "error": "seat_not_found",
  "message": "Seat 'seat_xyz' not found or not accessible"
}
```

## Sales Agent & Signals Agent Authentication

Sales agents and signals agents support multiple authentication mechanisms for secure communication with publisher endpoints. This section covers how to register agents with authentication and the approval process for live inventory access.

### Supported Authentication Types

The platform supports four authentication mechanisms for agent integrations:

#### Bearer Token Authentication
Simple token-based authentication using HTTP Authorization headers.

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "sales_agents_register",
  "parameters": {
    "name": "Publisher Direct Sales",
    "endpoint_url": "https://publisher.com/adcp",
    "auth_config": {
      "type": "bearer",
      "token": "your_bearer_token_here"
    }
  }
}
```

#### OAuth 2.0 Authentication
Automatic OAuth 2.0 authentication using publisher discovery and client registration.

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "sales_agents_register", 
  "parameters": {
    "name": "OAuth Publisher Integration",
    "endpoint_url": "https://publisher.com/adcp",
    "auth_config": {
      "type": "oauth",
      "issuer": "https://publisher.com",
      "scope": "adcp.read adcp.write"
    }
  }
}
```

The system automatically:
- Discovers OAuth endpoints via `.well-known` protocols
- Registers Scope3 as an authorized client with the publisher
- Manages token refresh and caching

<Note>
**Automatic OAuth Setup**: Scope3 handles all OAuth client registration and credential management. You only need to provide the publisher's OAuth issuer domain.
</Note>

#### Custom Headers Authentication
Custom header-based authentication (e.g., API keys in custom headers).

**Configuration Example:**
```json
{
  "tool": "sales_agents_register",
  "parameters": {
    "name": "API Key Publisher",
    "endpoint_url": "https://publisher.com/adcp", 
    "auth_config": {
      "type": "custom_header",
      "headerName": "x-api-key",
      "headerValue": "your_api_key_value"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Custom Integrations
Scope3 can build custom authentication integrations for specific publishers with unique authentication requirements.

<Note>
**Custom Integration Development:**
For publishers requiring specialized authentication flows (like proprietary JWT schemes), contact Scope3 to discuss custom integration development. These integrations are built on a case-by-case basis.
</Note>

### Registration Process

#### For Sales Agents
Use the `sales_agents_register` tool with authentication configuration:

```json
{
  "tool": "sales_agents_register",
  "parameters": {
    "name": "Publisher Sales Team",
    "endpoint_url": "https://publisher.com/adcp",
    "account_identifier": "your_publisher_account_id",
    "description": "Direct sales integration with Publisher",
    "auth_config": {
      "type": "bearer",
      "token": "secure_bearer_token"
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Signals Agents  
Use the `signals_agent_register` tool with optional authentication in config:

```json
{
  "tool": "signals_agent_register",
  "parameters": {
    "name": "Publisher Signals Agent",
    "endpointUrl": "https://publisher.com/signals",
    "brandAgentId": "brand_agent_123",
    "description": "Automated audience signals from Publisher",
    "config": {
      "auth_type": "oauth",
      "issuer": "https://publisher.com"
    }
  }
}
```

<Warning>
**Business Approval Required:**
All sales agents added by customers require Scope3 testing and approval before accessing live inventory. This ensures:
- Technical compatibility with publisher endpoints
- Authentication security validation  
- Compliance with platform standards
- Quality assurance for production use

Contact your Scope3 representative to initiate the approval process after registration.
