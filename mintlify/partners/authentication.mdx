## Overview

Partners and agent integrations require authentication to access platform resources. This guide covers API key setup and seat access discovery for multi-seat management.

## API Key Setup

All API requests require an API key in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Warning>
**API Key Security:**
- Get your Scope3 API key: [Get one here](https://scope3.com/integrate/api-keys)
- Use HTTPS only - never send keys over HTTP
- Store keys securely and rotate regularly
- Each API key provides access to specific seats based on your partner configuration
</Warning>

## Discovering Accessible Seats

### Check Seat Access

**MCP Tool**: `signals/get-partner-seats`

Use this tool to discover which brand agent seats your API key can access:

```json
{
  "tool": "signals/get-partner-seats",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

**Response includes:**
- Seat ID and display name
- Brand agent information
- Access permissions and scope
- Last activity date

### Using Seat Information

Once you know which seats you can access, you can:

**Filter operations by seat:**
```json
{
  "tool": "signals/list",
  "parameters": {
    "seatId": "seat_abc123"
  }
}
```

**Access seat-specific resources:**
- Signals and segments
- Campaign data
- Performance metrics
- Configuration settings

## Authentication Scopes

Partner API keys provide different access levels:

### Read Access
- List accessible seats
- View segments and signals
- Read campaign performance data
- Access reporting APIs

### Write Access  
- Create and update segments
- Attach data to segments
- Register signals agents
- Modify campaign configurations

### Administrative Access
- Manage API key permissions
- Configure seat access controls
- Set up webhook endpoints
- Access audit logs

## Multi-Seat Operations

When working across multiple seats, operations automatically scope to your accessible seats:

**List all segments across seats:**
```json
{
  "tool": "signals/list",
  "parameters": {}
}
```

**Results include seat information:**
- `seatId` - Unique seat identifier
- `seatName` - Human-readable seat name  
- Standard resource metadata

This enables you to understand which seat owns each resource and manage targeting at the seat level.

## Error Handling

**Common authentication errors:**

### Invalid API Key
```json
{
  "error": "unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or expired API key"
}
```

### Insufficient Permissions
```json
{
  "error": "forbidden", 
  "message": "API key does not have access to requested seat"
}
```

### Seat Not Found
```json
{
  "error": "seat_not_found",
  "message": "Seat 'seat_xyz' not found or not accessible"
}
```
