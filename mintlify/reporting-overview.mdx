## Core Reporting Tools

### 📊 Campaign Summary & Insights

Get comprehensive campaign analysis as structured JSON data. The summary includes:

- **Structured Data**: Campaign metrics, pacing analysis, and currency-aware monetary values
- **AI Insights**: Performance analysis with actionable recommendations, priority levels, and top tactics
- **External ID Support**: Client campaign IDs for addressability and integration
- **Text Summary**: Rich markdown text optimized for conversational interfaces like Claude and ChatGPT

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Real-time Insights
const summary = await getCampaignSummary({
  campaignId: "camp_airmax_123",
  includeCharts: true,
  verbosity: "detailed"
});

// Returns structured JSON for flexible client rendering
console.log(`Campaign Status: ${summary.pacing.status}`);
console.log(`Spend: ${summary.summary.spend} ${summary.currency}`);

// Access different insight types
const topTactics = summary.insights.find(i => i.type === 'top_tactics')?.tactics;
console.log(`Best Tactic: ${topTactics?.[0]?.description}`);

const optimizations = summary.insights.filter(i => i.type === 'optimization');
console.log(`Optimization Tips: ${optimizations.length}`);

// Rich text summary available for conversational interfaces
console.log(summary.textSummary);
```

```text Conversational
User: "How's my Nike campaign performing this week?"

Claude: [Uses summary.textSummary field]

### 📈 Data Export for BI & Analytics

Export structured data for business intelligence tools:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Enterprise Export
const exportResult = await exportCampaignData({
  brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123",
  datasets: ["delivery", "events", "tactics"],
  groupBy: ["date", "campaign", "signal", "story"],
  dateRange: { start: "2024-01-01", end: "2024-01-31" },
  format: "parquet",
  compression: "gzip"
});

// Perfect for data warehouses, dashboards, ML pipelines
console.log(`${exportResult.totalRecords} records ready`);
```

```sql BigQuery Integration
-- Import exported data into BigQuery
LOAD DATA INTO campaign_performance
FROM FILES ('gs://your-bucket/scope3_export_*.parquet.gz')
WITH PARTITION COLUMNS;

-- Analyze signal performance
SELECT 
  signal,
  AVG(cpm) as avg_cpm,
  AVG(ctr) as avg_ctr,
  SUM(conversions) as total_conversions
FROM campaign_performance
GROUP BY signal
ORDER BY avg_ctr DESC;
```

</CodeGroup>

### 🎯 ML-Powered Tactic Analysis  

Deep performance analysis with statistical significance testing:

```javascript
const analysis = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_airmax_123",
  analysisType: "signals",
  compareSignals: true,
  timeframe: "30d"
});

// Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
analysis.signalEffectiveness.forEach(signal => {
  console.log(`${signal.signal}: ${signal.effectivenessScore} (p=${signal.pValue})`);
  if (signal.pValue < 0.05) {
    console.log(`✅ Statistically significant improvement`);
  }
});
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Morning Campaign Review

```
User: "Show me how all my campaigns performed yesterday"

Claude: 📊 Portfolio Performance (Yesterday):

🏃 Running Campaign: $347 spend, 28K impressions, $12.39 CPM ✅ Healthy
👟 Air Max Campaign: $2,180 spend, 156K impressions, $13.97 CPM ✅ Healthy  
👕 Lifestyle Campaign: $892 spend, 67K impressions, $13.31 CPM ⚠️ Warning

⚠️ Alert: Lifestyle campaign CTR dropped to 0.6% (below 0.8% threshold)

```

### Weekly Performance Analysis

```javascript
// Export weekly data for team meeting
const weeklyReport = await exportCampaignData({
  brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123",
  dateRange: { start: "2024-01-08", end: "2024-01-14" },
  datasets: ["delivery", "events"],
  groupBy: ["date", "campaign", "creative"],
  format: "csv"
});

// Perfect for Excel analysis and presentations
console.log("Weekly report ready for download");

```

## Integration Patterns

### Real-time Dashboard

Monitor campaigns with live updates:

```javascript
// Get campaign insights for dashboard
async function updateDashboard() {
  const campaigns = await listCampaigns({ brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123" });
  
  for (const campaign of campaigns.campaigns) {
    const summary = await getCampaignSummary({ 
      campaignId: campaign.id,
      verbosity: "brief" 
    });
    
    updateCampaignWidget(campaign.id, {
      healthScore: summary.healthScore,
      spend: summary.todaySpend,
      impressions: summary.todayImpressions,
      alerts: summary.alerts
    });
  }
}
```

### Data Pipeline

Automated export for BI systems:

```python
# Daily ETL pipeline
def daily_campaign_export():
    yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    
    export_result = client.export_campaign_data(
        brand_agent_id="ba_nike_123",
        date_range={"start": yesterday, "end": yesterday},
        datasets=["delivery", "events", "tactics"],
        group_by=["date", "campaign", "signal", "story"],
        format="parquet"
    )
    
    # Load into data warehouse
    load_to_warehouse(export_result['downloadUrl'])
```
