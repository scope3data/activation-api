## Understanding the Concept Mapping

Before diving into migration, it's important to understand how your existing concepts map to Scope3's agentic model:

    | **Audience** | Synthetic Audience | AI-enhanced with lookalike modeling |
    | **Data Partner** | Measurement Source | Analytics and conversion tracking |
    | **Brand Safety** | Brand Standards | Domain blocking and content filtering |
  </Tab>

## Key Differences to Understand

<Warning>
**Important Mindset Shift**

Traditional DSPs require you to think in terms of technical parameters and manual optimization. Scope3's agentic approach lets you think in terms of business objectives and natural language descriptions.

Instead of: "Create a line item targeting males 25-34 with CPC bidding at $2.50"
You say: "Target young professional males interested in our product with a $5000 budget"

</Warning>

### What's Different (and Better)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hierarchical Organization">
    **Traditional:** Flat campaign structures with complex relationships
    
    **Scope3:** Brand agents own everything - campaigns, creatives, audiences, and settings all belong to a single brand agent container
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Campaign Creation">
  **Traditional:** Forms with dozens of targeting parameters and technical
  settings **Scope3:** Natural language prompts that get converted to optimal
  technical configurations by AI
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creative Management">
  **Traditional:** Creatives tied to specific campaigns or line items
  **Scope3:** Creatives belong to brand agents and can be reused across any
  campaign within that brand
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audience Targeting">
  **Traditional:** Manual audience segment selection and configuration
  **Scope3:** Synthetic audiences built from natural language descriptions with
  AI enhancement
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Optimization">
    **Traditional:** Manual bid adjustments and targeting refinements
    
    **Scope3:** Continuous AI-powered optimization based on performance goals and real-time signals
  </Accordion>

## Timeline Expectations

<Tip>
**Typical Migration Timeline:**

- **Small Accounts (1-10 campaigns):** 1-2 days
- **Medium Accounts (10-50 campaigns):** 1 week
- **Large Accounts (50+ campaigns):** 2-4 weeks
- **Enterprise Accounts (Complex setups):** 4-8 weeks with dedicated support

Most of the time is spent in validation and testing, not technical migration.
