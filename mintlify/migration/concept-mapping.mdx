# Platform Concept Mapping

Understanding how your existing DSP concepts translate to Scope3's agentic model is crucial for a successful migration. This guide provides detailed mappings for major advertising platforms.

## Quick Reference Table

<Note>
**Universal Mapping**
All major DSPs follow similar hierarchical patterns. Here's how they map to Scope3:

| Traditional DSP Layer         | Scope3 Equivalent   | Purpose                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Account/Advertiser**        | Brand Agent         | Top-level container for all assets  |
| **Campaign/Order**            | Brand Agent Context | Organizational grouping (flattened) |
| **Line Item/Insertion Order** | Campaign            | Individual budget allocation        |
| **Creative**                  | Creative            | Ad assets (enhanced sharing)        |
| **Audience/Segment**          | Synthetic Audience  | AI-enhanced targeting profiles      |
| **Conversion/Pixel**          | Measurement Source  | Analytics and tracking              |
| **Brand Safety**              | Brand Standards     | Content filtering and compliance    |

## The Trade Desk → Scope3

    ### Account Hierarchy Mapping

    **The Trade Desk Structure:**
    ```
    Advertiser
    ├── Campaign
    │   ├── Line Item
    │   │   ├── Creatives
    │   │   ├── Audiences
    │   │   └── Targeting
    │   └── Brand Safety
    └── Data Partners
    ```

    **Scope3 Structure:**
    ```
    Brand Agent (Advertiser)
    ├── Campaigns (Line Items)
    ├── Creatives (shared)
    ├── Synthetic Audiences (shared)
    ├── Brand Standards (Brand Safety)
    └── Measurement Sources (Data Partners)
    ```

    ### Key Differences
    - **Flatter Hierarchy:** TTD's Campaign layer is removed; Line Items become our Campaigns
    - **Shared Resources:** Creatives and audiences are shared across all campaigns within a brand agent
    - **Natural Language:** Campaign targeting defined through prompts, not parameter forms

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Campaign Management">
    ### Campaign Configuration

    | TTD Configuration | Scope3 Equivalent | Example |
    |------------------|------------------|---------|
    | **Campaign Name** | Brand Agent Context | Used for organizational grouping |
    | **Line Item Name** | Campaign Name | "Q4 Holiday Video Push" |
    | **Objective** | Campaign Prompt | "Target holiday shoppers with video ads focusing on gift-giving" |
    | **Budget & Pacing** | Campaign Budget | Same budget controls, AI-optimized pacing |
    | **Flight Dates** | Campaign Schedule | Handled in campaign configuration |
    | **Bid Strategy** | AI-Managed | Automatic optimization based on goals |

    ### Targeting Translation
    ```json
    // TTD Line Item Targeting
    {
      "demographics": {"age": "25-34", "gender": "M"},
      "interests": ["technology", "gaming"],
      "geo": ["US-NY", "US-CA"],
      "daypart": "evening"
    }

    // Scope3 Campaign Prompt
    "Target tech-savvy males aged 25-34 in New York and California during evening hours"
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Creative & Audiences">
    ### Creative Management

    **TTD Approach:**
    - Creatives uploaded per line item
    - Manual creative rotation settings
    - Separate approval workflow

    **Scope3 Approach:**
    - Creatives belong to brand agent
    - Automatically available to all campaigns
    - AI-optimized creative selection

    ### Audience Segments

    | TTD Audience Type | Scope3 Equivalent | Enhancement |
    |------------------|------------------|-------------|
    | **1st Party Data** | Synthetic Audience | Enhanced with lookalike modeling |
    | **3rd Party Segments** | Synthetic Audience | AI-curated from multiple sources |
    | **Lookalike Audiences** | Synthetic Audience | Built-in with continuous learning |
    | **Geo-fencing** | Campaign Targeting | Natural language geo descriptions |
    | **Behavioral Targeting** | Synthetic Audience | Intent-based AI targeting |

    ```python
    # TTD Audience Creation
    audience = ttd.create_audience({
        "name": "Tech Enthusiasts",
        "segments": ["tech_interest", "high_income"],
        "lookalike_seed": "customer_list_id"
    })

    # Scope3 Audience Creation
    audience = scope3.create_audience(
        brand_agent_id="ba_123",
        name="Tech Enthusiasts",
        description="People interested in latest technology with disposable income for premium products"
    )
    ```

    prompt="""
    Target college students and young professionals aged 18-25 
    interested in athletic wear and fitness. Focus on back-to-school

## Best Practices for Migration

<Warning>
**Migration Gotchas**

1. **Don't Over-Specify:** Scope3's AI works best with natural language goals, not technical parameters
2. **Think Business Outcomes:** Focus on what you want to achieve, not how to achieve it
3. **Leverage Shared Resources:** Take advantage of brand agent-level creative and audience sharing
4. **Start Small:** Migrate a few campaigns first to understand the differences before bulk migration
   </Warning>

<Tip>
**Migration Success Tips**

✅ **Do:** Use descriptive campaign names and clear business objectives in prompts
✅ **Do:** Consolidate similar audiences into synthetic audience descriptions  
✅ **Do:** Take advantage of automatic optimization rather than manual controls
✅ **Do:** Test with small budgets initially to validate performance

❌ **Don't:** Try to recreate exact targeting parameter combinations
❌ **Don't:** Create separate creatives for each campaign - use the shared library
❌ **Don't:** Over-optimize initially - let the AI learn your performance patterns
