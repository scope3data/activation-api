The Scope3 Ad Platform is built as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, designed for seamless integration with AI agents and conversational interfaces.

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external systems and data sources. It enables AI assistants to:

  <Card title="Execute Functions" icon="play">
    Make real API calls with actual business effects
  </Card>
  <Card title="Access Structured Data" icon="database">
    Query and manipulate complex advertising data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Maintain Context" icon="memory">
    Remember campaign details across conversations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Tool Coordination" icon="network-wired">

For advertising teams, this means you can manage campaigns through **natural language conversations** with AI agents.

## Natural Language Campaign Management

### Conversational Workflow Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Campaign Creation">
    ```
    Human: "Create a brand awareness campaign for our new sustainable 
            sneaker line, targeting eco-conscious millennials with a $75K budget"

    AI Agent: I'll create that campaign for you. Let me set up:

    â†’ create_brand_agent({ name: "EcoStep Footwear" })
    â†’ create_campaign({
        brandAgentId: "ba_123",
        name: "Sustainable Sneaker Launch",
        prompt: "Target eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
        budget: { total: 75000, currency: "USD" }
      })

    âœ… Campaign created! Using built-in optimization to find the best
       inventory mix for eco-conscious millennials. Expected reach: 2.5M people.
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Inventory Discovery">
    ```
    Human: "Find me premium CTV inventory under $35 CPM"

    AI Agent: â†’ discover_publisher_products({
        formats: ["video"],
        deliveryType: "ctv",
        maxCpm: 35,
        quality: "premium"
      })

    Found 12 premium CTV options under $35 CPM:
    ðŸ“º Hulu Premium CTV - $28 CPM, 85% completion rate
    ðŸ“º Samsung TV Plus Premium - $32 CPM, viewability 95%
    ðŸ“º Roku Premium Inventory - $30 CPM, brand-safe content
    ðŸ“º YouTube Select CTV - $34 CPM, high engagement
    ...
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Performance Analysis">
    ```
    Human: "How is our sneaker campaign performing? Focus on CTV vs display"

    AI Agent: â†’ analyze_inventory_performance({
        campaignId: "camp_456",
        groupBy: ["format", "inventorySource"]
      })

    ðŸ“Š Performance Breakdown (Last 7 days):

    CTV Inventory:
    â€¢ $45K spent, 1.8M impressions, 0.85% CTR
    â€¢ Top performer: Hulu Premium (1.2% CTR)

## Why MCP for Advertising?

Traditional advertising platforms require:

- Complex UI navigation
- Technical expertise in programmatic advertising
- Manual optimization and monitoring
- Separate tools for different functions

**MCP-enabled advertising allows:**

- Natural language campaign management
- AI-powered optimization and analysis
- Unified interface for all advertising functions
- Collaborative human-AI workflows

<Tip>
  **The Future of AdTech:** MCP represents a fundamental shift toward
  conversational interfaces in advertising technology. Instead of learning
  complex systems, teams can focus on strategy while AI handles tactical
  execution.
