# Scope3 Campaign API MCP Server

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides comprehensive tools for managing advertising campaigns, brand agents, creatives, and targeting through the Scope3 API. The server follows an advertiser/account-based architecture where brand agents act as top-level containers that own campaigns, creatives, audiences, standards, and measurement sources.

## 🏗️ The Three-Pillar Architecture

**Scope3 Campaign API** is built on **three interdependent pillars** that form the foundation of enterprise advertising automation. **You cannot build successful campaigns without all three working together.**

<Warning>

## Architecture Overview

The API uses a hierarchical **Brand Agent** model that mirrors traditional ad tech advertiser/account structures:

```
BrandAgent (Advertiser/Account)
  ├── Campaigns (multiple, owned by brand agent)
  ├── Creative Library (AdCP-aligned creative workflows)
  │   ├── Creatives (contain multiple assets)
  │   └── Assets (images, videos, text, audio, etc.)
  ├── Standards (brand safety configuration)
  ├── SyntheticAudiences (multiple, shared across campaigns)
  └── MeasurementSources (tracking integrations)
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Advertiser-Centric**: Brand agents act as advertiser accounts that own all resources
- **Resource Sharing**: Creatives and audiences can be reused across campaigns within the same brand agent
- **MCP + REST Architecture**: MCP handles orchestration, REST handles file uploads and bulk data
- **Format-Driven**: Creative formats from AdCP, publishers, and creative agents determine assembly methods
- **Content Source Flexibility**: Supports ad server tags, asset references, product URLs, and creative agents
- **Human-Readable APIs**: All field names are verbose and descriptive for optimal LLM usage
- **Real-World Workflows**: Third-party ad tags, trafficking sheets, asset libraries, creative agents
- **Enterprise Scale**: Reference-based asset management for millions of assets
- **Natural Language**: All tools work conversationally with Claude

## 🏗️ MCP Orchestration + REST Upload Architecture

**For Developers**: This platform uses a **two-layer architecture** that separates concerns for optimal performance and developer experience:

### **MCP Layer (Orchestration & Control)**

- **Purpose**: Workflow orchestration via natural language tool calls
- **Handles**: Creative format specification, content references, campaign assignments
- **Examples**: `creative/create`, `assets/add`, `list_creative_formats`
- **Data Types**: Metadata, references, configuration, orchestration commands
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast API calls and natural language processing

### **REST Layer (Data & File Operations)**

- **Purpose**: File uploads, bulk operations, and data storage
- **Handles**: Actual file uploads, presigned URLs, bulk asset imports
- **Examples**: `POST /api/assets/upload`, `GET /api/assets/upload-url`
- **Data Types**: Binary files, large datasets, bulk operations
- **Performance**: Optimized for file transfer and data processing

### **Why This Separation Matters**

```typescript
// ❌ Wrong: Uploading files via MCP
"Upload this 50MB video file via creative/upload_asset"
// Problems: Timeouts, base64 bloat, poor performance

// ✅ Right: MCP orchestration + REST uploads
1. REST: POST /api/assets/upload → returns uploadId
2. MCP: "Add asset with uploadId upload_789"
3. MCP: "Create creative using asset asset_123"
```

**Benefits:**

- ⚡ **Performance**: No file transfer bottlenecks in MCP layer
- 🎯 **Separation**: MCP focuses on orchestration, REST on data
- 🏗️ **Scalability**: Handle enterprise file volumes efficiently
- 🔧 **Flexibility**: Support presigned URLs, CDN integration, bulk operations

## 🎨 Creatives - Core Workflows

**Creatives are the engine that powers high-performing campaigns.** This module handles the complete creative lifecycle from asset creation to performance optimization.

### Creative Lifecycle & Publisher Approval

**The Creative Journey from Creation to Campaign:**

```
1. Create on Scope3 → 2. Validate Assets → 3. Sync to Publishers → 4. Get Approval → 5. Deploy to Campaigns
```

**Key Workflow Points:**

- **Creation**: Creatives are created on Scope3 but NOT automatically synced to publishers
- **Asset Validation**: System validates all assets can be downloaded and match requirements
- **Publisher Sync**: When campaign selects inventory OR via pre-approval request
- **Approval Process**: Publishers may auto-approve standard formats or require manual review
- **Rejection Handling**: Revise and re-sync based on publisher feedback
- **Campaign Deployment**: Only approved creatives can run on publisher inventory

### Why Start with Creatives?

**Creative quality is the primary driver of campaign performance.** Before launching campaigns, you need:

- ✅ **Reusable Asset Library**: Upload logos, fonts, brand guidelines once, use everywhere
- ✅ **Multi-Format Creatives**: Generate display, video, native, and audio creatives from the same assets
- ✅ **Publisher Pre-Approval**: Get creatives approved before campaign launch
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Handle asset failures and publisher rejections gracefully

### 🛠️ **Developer Implementation Workflows**

<Tip>
**Integration Strategy**: Creative management integrates seamlessly with **natural language commands**. Your users can create and manage creatives conversationally, while your backend handles the technical complexity automatically.
</Tip>

#### **Critical Integration Pattern #1: Brand Agent → Creative → Campaign**

This is the **REQUIRED** implementation order for successful campaign deployment:

**Step 1: Foundation Setup** ✅

```typescript
// 1. Create brand agent (foundation)
"Create a brand agent for Nike"
→ create_brand_agent → returns ba_123
```

**Step 2: Creative Integration**

```typescript
// 2. Build creative library (important for campaign success)
"Create a creative called 'Summer Sale' for buyer agent ba_123 with banner and headline"
→ creative/create → Creates creative cr_456 with multiple assets

// 3. Upload reusable assets for brand consistency
"Upload Nike logo for buyer agent ba_123"
→ creative/upload_asset → Creates reusable brand asset
```

**Step 3: Campaign Deployment** 🚀

```typescript
// 4. Create campaign with creative integration
"Create $50K campaign for ba_123 using creative cr_456"
→ create_campaign → Campaign with creative ready to launch

// 5. Monitor creative performance
"Show campaign creative performance"
→ campaign/list_creatives → ROI optimization insights
```

<Tip>
**Recommendation**: Setting up creatives before campaigns provides better workflow organization and reduces manual asset management overhead.
</Tip>

**Note**: API keys are never stored server-side and must be provided by the client in each request.

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

This MCP server runs in HTTP mode only. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001/mcp`.

**Health Check**: Built-in health endpoint at `/health`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Returns "ok"
```

**Authentication**: Include your Scope3 API key in requests:

```bash
curl -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_api_key" http://localhost:3001/mcp
```

### HTTP Mode

The server runs in HTTP mode by default:

```bash
npm start  # Starts on port 3001
```

Or specify a custom port:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

## Implementation Insights & Learnings

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Advertiser/Account Pattern**: After consulting with ad tech protocol experts, we confirmed that brand agents should act as advertiser-level containers, which aligns with industry standards.

2. **Create/Update Pattern for Creative Assignment**: Instead of separate assignment tools, we follow the existing pattern where creatives are assigned during campaign creation or via updates. This maintains API consistency.

3. **Stub Architecture**: Advanced features (standards, audiences, measurement) are implemented as extensible stubs. This provides immediate usability while allowing for detailed implementation later.

4. **Resource Ownership Model**: Clear hierarchy where brand agents own all resources, but campaigns reference shared assets like creatives and audiences.

5. **Flat vs Hierarchical URLs**: After protocol review, we chose a hybrid approach - brand agents are contexts for creation, but resources remain accessible via flat IDs for flexibility.

### Technical Learnings

**TypeScript Configuration**: The project initially used `@tsconfig/node22` which wasn't available. We replaced it with a custom configuration targeting ES2020 with proper Node.js types.

**ESLint Rules**: Strict rules against `any` types required using `Record<string, unknown>` for flexible object types. Unused variables in destructuring assignments need explicit ignoring with `[, value]`.

**MCP Tool Patterns**: Consistent patterns across all tools:

- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Auth checking with fallback to environment variables
- Human-readable response formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear annotations and descriptions

**GraphQL Query Organization**: Separating brand agent queries into their own file maintains clean code organization while extending the existing client architecture.

### Development Best Practices Discovered

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Building core functionality first (CRUD operations) then adding specialized features allows for better testing and validation.

2. **Type-First Development**: Defining comprehensive TypeScript interfaces before implementation prevents structural issues and ensures consistency.

3. **Tool Naming Consistency**: Following the pattern `verb_noun` (e.g., `create_brand_agent`, `list_campaigns`) makes tools intuitive for conversational AI.

4. **Human-Readable Responses**: Rich text responses with emojis, formatting, and actionable insights significantly improve user experience.

5. **Stub Pattern**: Implementing stubs with clear documentation about future expansion provides immediate value while maintaining development flexibility.

### Architecture Benefits Realized

- **Clean Separation**: Brand agent ownership model eliminates ambiguity about resource relationships
- **Natural Workflows**: The advertiser → campaign → creative flow mirrors real advertising workflows
- **Extensibility**: Stub implementations provide clear paths for feature expansion
- **Tool Consistency**: All 20+ tools follow identical patterns for parameter handling, auth, and responses
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience

## Documentation Development

The project includes comprehensive Mintlify documentation with integrated validation:

### Local Development

```bash
npm run docs:dev  # Start local documentation server
```

### Validation Commands

**Prerequisites**: Requires Mintlify CLI: `npm install -g mintlify`

```bash
npm run docs:validate:openapi  # Validate OpenAPI spec (requires Mintlify CLI)
npm run docs:validate:links    # Check for broken links (informational)
npm run docs:validate          # Run full validation
```

The documentation validation is available as:

- **Optional local validation**: Requires Mintlify CLI to be installed globally
- **Separate from CI**: Documentation validation doesn't block main CI pipeline
- **Development workflow**: Easy local validation when Mintlify CLI is available
- **OpenAPI consistency**: Ensures documentation stays in sync with API spec
