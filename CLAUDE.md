For documenting an MCP (Model Context Protocol) API to serve both humans and LLMs effectively, you should create a multi-layered documentation approach that combines structured schemas with natural language explanations:

## Core Documentation Strategy

**1. OpenAPI/JSON Schema as the Foundation**
Start with a machine-readable OpenAPI specification or JSON Schema that defines your API precisely. This gives LLMs unambiguous structure while serving as the source of truth:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: MCP Tool API
  description: |
    This API enables context-aware tool execution.
    LLMs should use the search_documents tool when users ask about finding information.
paths:
  /tools/search_documents:
    post:
      operationId: searchDocuments
      description: Searches through available documents using semantic search
      x-llm-hints:
        - "Use this when users ask to 'find', 'search', or 'look for' information"
        - "Returns up to 10 results by default"
```

**2. Structured Tool Descriptions**
For MCP specifically, follow the protocol's tool description format but enhance it with examples:

```json
{
  "name": "search_documents",
  "description": "Search through documents using natural language queries",
  "inputSchema": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "query": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Natural language search query",
        "examples": ["latest sales figures", "customer feedback from Q3"]
      }
    }
  },
  "usage_examples": [
    {
      "user_says": "Find our recent performance metrics",
      "tool_call": {"query": "performance metrics recent"}
    }
  ]
}
```

**3. Dual-Purpose Markdown Documentation**
Create markdown files that work for both audiences:

```markdown
# Document Search Tool

## Overview
Searches through available documents using semantic search to find relevant content.

## When to Use
- User asks to "find", "search for", or "look up" information
- User references documents they don't have direct access to
- User needs information that might be in stored documents

## Parameters
- `query` (string, required): Natural language description of what to search for
  - Keep queries concise (3-7 words optimal)
  - Use key terms from the user's request
  - Avoid filler words like "please find"

## Examples
User: "What did we discuss about the product roadmap?"
Call: search_documents(query="product roadmap discussion")
```

**4. Include Behavioral Hints**
Add sections specifically for LLM behavior:

```markdown
## LLM Usage Guidelines
- Always search before claiming information is unavailable
- If initial search returns no results, try broadening the query
- Combine multiple tool calls for complex research questions
- Cite specific documents when referencing search results
```

**5. Provide a Quick Reference Card**
Create a condensed version for quick parsing:

```yaml
tool_matrix:
  search_documents:
    triggers: ["find", "search", "look for", "what about"]
    avoid_when: ["user provides specific document ID"]
    combines_well_with: ["get_document", "summarize"]
    rate_limits: "100/minute"
```

## Best Practices

**Structure for Scanning**: Use consistent headers and formatting. LLMs can quickly parse well-structured documents, while humans can navigate visually.

**Progressive Disclosure**: Start with essential information, then provide detailed specifications. Both audiences can stop reading when they have enough.

**Concrete Examples**: Show actual request/response pairs. LLMs learn patterns from examples, and humans understand through demonstration.

**Version Everything**: Include version numbers in your schemas and documentation. Both LLMs and developers need to know which version they're working with.

**Test Your Documentation**: Regularly test whether LLMs can correctly use your API based solely on the documentation. If an LLM struggles, a human developer likely will too.

The key is creating documentation that's simultaneously precise enough for machine interpretation and clear enough for human understandingâ€”structured data with natural language context achieves both goals effectively.
