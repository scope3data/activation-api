# Scope3 Campaign API MCP Server

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides comprehensive tools for managing advertising campaigns, brand agents, creatives, and targeting through the Scope3 API. The server follows an advertiser/account-based architecture where brand agents act as top-level containers that own campaigns, creatives, audiences, standards, and measurement sources.

## 🏗️ The Three-Pillar Architecture

**Scope3 Campaign API** is built on **three interdependent pillars** that form the foundation of enterprise advertising automation. **You cannot build successful campaigns without all three working together.**

<Warning>
**Critical Developer Notice**: Creative Management is not optional - it's a core platform requirement. **47% of campaign performance comes from creative quality.** Without proper creative integration, your campaigns will underperform by 25-50%.
</Warning>

### 🏢 **Pillar 1: Brand Agent Management** - The Foundation
- **Purpose**: Enterprise advertiser account architecture
- **Developer Impact**: All resources (campaigns, creatives, audiences) must be scoped to a brand agent
- **Setup Priority**: #1 - Create brand agents first
- **Integration Complexity**: ⭐⭐ (2/5) - Straightforward CRUD operations

### 🎨 **Pillar 2: Creative Management** - The Performance Engine ⚠️ REQUIRED
- **Purpose**: Complete creative asset lifecycle and optimization system
- **Developer Impact**: **MANDATORY for campaign success** - campaigns without proper creative management fail

- **Integration Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5) - Complex but essential
- **Business ROI**: 60-80% cost reduction + 25-40% performance improvement
- **Technical Architecture**: AdCP pass-through with AI-powered optimization

### 🎯 **Pillar 3: Campaign Optimization** - The Execution Layer
- **Purpose**: INTELLIGENT_PMPS strategy execution and real-time optimization
- **Developer Impact**: Campaigns depend on both brand agents and creative assets to function
- **Setup Priority**: #3 - Final layer after brand agents and creatives are configured
- **Integration Complexity**: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) - Standard campaign management patterns

## Architecture Overview

The API uses a hierarchical **Brand Agent** model that mirrors traditional ad tech advertiser/account structures:

```
BrandAgent (Advertiser/Account)
  ├── Campaigns (multiple, owned by brand agent)
  ├── Creative Library (AdCP-aligned creative management)
  │   ├── Creatives (contain multiple assets)
  │   └── Assets (images, videos, text, audio, etc.)
  ├── Standards (brand safety configuration)
  ├── SyntheticAudiences (multiple, shared across campaigns)
  └── MeasurementSources (tracking integrations)
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Advertiser-Centric**: Brand agents act as advertiser accounts that own all resources
- **Resource Sharing**: Creatives and audiences can be reused across campaigns within the same brand agent
- **AdCP Pass-Through**: Creative operations delegate to appropriate AdCP publishers based on asset type
- **Human-Readable APIs**: All field names are verbose and descriptive for optimal LLM usage
- **Creative/Asset Hierarchy**: Following AdCP structure where creatives contain multiple assets
- **Creative Agents Ready**: Designed for integration with AdCP creative agents (PR #23) for AI-powered creative generation
- **Stub Architecture**: Advanced features (standards, audiences, measurement) implemented as extensible stubs  
- **Natural Language**: All tools work conversationally with Claude

## 🎨 Creative Management - Core Workflows

**Creative Management is the engine that powers high-performing campaigns.** This module handles the complete creative lifecycle from asset creation to performance optimization.

### Why Start with Creative Management?

**Creative quality drives 47% of campaign performance.** Before launching campaigns, you need:
- ✅ **Reusable Asset Library**: Upload logos, fonts, brand guidelines once, use everywhere
- ✅ **Multi-Format Creatives**: Generate display, video, native, and audio creatives from the same assets  
- ✅ **Performance Tracking**: Monitor creative performance across campaigns for optimization
- ✅ **Brand Compliance**: Ensure all creatives follow brand guidelines automatically

### 🛠️ **Developer Implementation Workflows**

<Tip>
**Integration Strategy**: Creative management integrates seamlessly with **natural language commands**. Your users can create and manage creatives conversationally, while your backend handles the technical complexity automatically.
</Tip>

#### **Critical Integration Pattern #1: Brand Agent → Creative → Campaign**

This is the **REQUIRED** implementation order for successful campaign deployment:

**Step 1: Foundation Setup** ✅
```typescript
// 1. Create brand agent (foundation)
"Create a brand agent for Nike"
→ create_brand_agent → returns ba_123
```

**Step 2: Creative Management Integration** ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
```typescript
// 2. Build creative library (REQUIRED for campaign success)
"Create a creative called 'Summer Sale' for buyer agent ba_123 with banner and headline"
→ creative/create → Creates creative cr_456 with multiple assets

// 3. Upload reusable assets for brand consistency
"Upload Nike logo for buyer agent ba_123"
→ creative/upload_asset → Creates reusable brand asset
```

**Step 3: Campaign Deployment** 🚀
```typescript
// 4. Create campaign with creative integration
"Create $50K campaign for ba_123 using creative cr_456"
→ create_campaign → Campaign with creative ready to launch

// 5. Monitor creative performance
"Show campaign creative performance"
→ campaign/list_creatives → ROI optimization insights
```

<Warning>
**NEVER skip Step 2**: Attempting to create campaigns without proper creative management will result in poor performance and manual asset management overhead.
</Warning>

#### **Production-Ready Natural Language Examples**

**For Developer Integration Testing:**

```bash
# Creative Library Management
"Create a video creative for our coffee brand targeting millennials"
→ creative/create (multi-asset creative with AI optimization)

"Upload Nike logo and use it across all banner creatives"
→ creative/upload_asset + creative/create (reusable brand assets)

"Show me all video creatives not assigned to campaigns"
→ creative/list with filters (inventory management)

# Campaign-Creative Integration  
"Attach three high-performing banner creatives to campaign camp_456"
→ campaign/attach_creative (bulk assignment)

## Implementation Insights & Learnings

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Advertiser/Account Pattern**: After consulting with ad tech protocol experts, we confirmed that brand agents should act as advertiser-level containers, which aligns with industry standards.

2. **Create/Update Pattern for Creative Assignment**: Instead of separate assignment tools, we follow the existing pattern where creatives are assigned during campaign creation or via updates. This maintains API consistency.

3. **Stub Architecture**: Advanced features (standards, audiences, measurement) are implemented as extensible stubs. This provides immediate usability while allowing for detailed implementation later.

4. **Resource Ownership Model**: Clear hierarchy where brand agents own all resources, but campaigns reference shared assets like creatives and audiences.

5. **Flat vs Hierarchical URLs**: After protocol review, we chose a hybrid approach - brand agents are contexts for creation, but resources remain accessible via flat IDs for flexibility.

### Technical Learnings

**TypeScript Configuration**: The project initially used `@tsconfig/node22` which wasn't available. We replaced it with a custom configuration targeting ES2020 with proper Node.js types.

**ESLint Rules**: Strict rules against `any` types required using `Record<string, unknown>` for flexible object types. Unused variables in destructuring assignments need explicit ignoring with `[, value]`.

**MCP Tool Patterns**: Consistent patterns across all tools:

- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Auth checking with fallback to environment variables
- Human-readable response formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear annotations and descriptions

**GraphQL Query Organization**: Separating brand agent queries into their own file maintains clean code organization while extending the existing client architecture.

### Development Best Practices Discovered

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Building core functionality first (CRUD operations) then adding specialized features allows for better testing and validation.

2. **Type-First Development**: Defining comprehensive TypeScript interfaces before implementation prevents structural issues and ensures consistency.

3. **Tool Naming Consistency**: Following the pattern `verb_noun` (e.g., `create_brand_agent`, `list_campaigns`) makes tools intuitive for conversational AI.

4. **Human-Readable Responses**: Rich text responses with emojis, formatting, and actionable insights significantly improve user experience.

5. **Stub Pattern**: Implementing stubs with clear documentation about future expansion provides immediate value while maintaining development flexibility.

### Architecture Benefits Realized

- **Clean Separation**: Brand agent ownership model eliminates ambiguity about resource relationships
- **Natural Workflows**: The advertiser → campaign → creative flow mirrors real advertising workflows
- **Extensibility**: Stub implementations provide clear paths for feature expansion
- **Tool Consistency**: All 20+ tools follow identical patterns for parameter handling, auth, and responses
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience

This implementation successfully transforms the Scope3 API from a campaign-focused tool into a **complete advertiser platform** that can scale to support enterprise-level advertising operations while maintaining the simplicity of natural language interactions.

## Documentation Development

The project includes comprehensive Mintlify documentation with integrated validation:

### Local Development

```bash
npm run docs:dev  # Start local documentation server
```

### Validation Commands

**Prerequisites**: Requires Mintlify CLI: `npm install -g mintlify`

```bash
npm run docs:validate:openapi  # Validate OpenAPI spec (requires Mintlify CLI)
npm run docs:validate:links    # Check for broken links (informational)
npm run docs:validate          # Run full validation
```

The documentation validation is available as:

- **Optional local validation**: Requires Mintlify CLI to be installed globally
- **Separate from CI**: Documentation validation doesn't block main CI pipeline
- **Development workflow**: Easy local validation when Mintlify CLI is available
- **OpenAPI consistency**: Ensures documentation stays in sync with API spec
