## Terminology Guide

**Brand Agent** = Your advertiser account (like a Google Ads account)  
**Campaign** = Marketing strategy with budget, targeting, and optimization  
**Creative** = Your actual ad content (video, image, text)  
**Tactic** = Algorithm-driven optimization approach within a campaign  
**Signal** = Data input for optimization (age, interests, behavior)  
**Story** = Narrative context that guides your campaign messaging  
**Delivery** = Real-time spend, impressions, and performance data

---

## Architecture Overview

### Why Brand Agents?

The API mirrors how advertising actually works - you need an advertiser account (brand agent) that owns all your marketing assets and campaigns. This is the same pattern used by:

- Google Ads (Advertiser Account → Campaigns)
- Facebook Business Manager (Ad Account → Campaigns)
- The Trade Desk (Advertiser → Campaigns)

### Resource Hierarchy

The API uses a hierarchical **Brand Agent** model that mirrors traditional ad tech advertiser/account structures:

```
BrandAgent (Advertiser/Account)
  ├── Campaigns (multiple, owned by brand agent)
  │   ├── Delivery Summary (real-time pacing, health scores)
  │   ├── Notification Thresholds (automated alerts)
  │   └── Tactics (signal/story components)
  ├── Creatives (multiple, shared across campaigns)
  ├── Standards (brand safety configuration)
  ├── SyntheticAudiences (multiple, shared across campaigns)
  ├── MeasurementSources (tracking integrations)
  └── Webhook Subscriptions (real-time notifications)
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Advertiser-Centric**: Brand agents act as advertiser accounts that own all resources
- **Resource Sharing**: Creatives and audiences can be reused across campaigns within the same brand agent
- **Create/Update Pattern**: Creative assignment follows consistent patterns (no separate assignment tools)
- **Dual-Mode Reporting**: Casual user summaries with natural language + enterprise data exports
- **Real-time Integration**: Webhook notifications and integrated delivery summaries
- **Signal/Story Analytics**: First-class support for tactic component analysis
- **RL-Ready Events**: Generic event model with reinforcement learning rewards
- **Natural Language**: All tools work conversationally with Claude

```javascript
// Register webhook for real-time campaign events
const webhookConfig = {
  brandAgentId: "ba_abc123",
  endpoint: {
    url: "https://your-domain.com/webhooks/scope3",
    method: "POST",
    authentication: {
      type: "hmac",
      credentials: process.env.WEBHOOK_SECRET,
    },
  },

  retryPolicy: {
    maxRetries: 25,
    backoffMultiplier: 2.0,
  },
};
```

#### Data Export for BI Systems

```javascript
// Export campaign data for analytics
const exportParams = {
  brandAgentId: "ba_abc123",
  dateRange: { start: "2024-01-01", end: "2024-01-31" },
  datasets: ["delivery", "events", "tactics"],
  groupBy: ["date", "tactic", "signal", "story"],
  format: "parquet",
  compression: "gzip",
};
```

### Schema & Data Models

#### Campaign Event Structure

```typescript
interface CampaignEvent {
  id: string;
  eventType: "impression" | "click" | "conversion";
  campaignId: string;
  tacticId: string;
  signals: string[]; // ["age_25_34", "interest_sports"]
  stories: string[]; // ["performance", "lifestyle"]
  reward: {
    immediate: number; // 0.0 to 1.0 reward score
    delayed?: number; // Optional future reward
    confidence?: number; // ML confidence in reward
  };
}
```

#### Delivery Data Structure

```typescript
interface TacticDelivery {
  date: string; // "2024-01-15"
  tacticId: string;
  spend: number;
  impressions: number;
  averagePrice: number; // CPM in currency units
  signals: string[];
  stories: string[];
}
```

### Error Handling Patterns

```javascript
try {
  const summary = await getCampaignSummary({ campaignId: "camp_123" });
} catch (error) {
  if (error.code === "AUTH_INVALID") {
    // Refresh API key
  } else if (error.code === "CAMPAIGN_NOT_FOUND") {
    // Handle missing campaign
  } else if (error.code === "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED") {
    // Implement exponential backoff
  }
}
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Alert Notifications**: Set up via Scope3 dashboard for instant campaign alerts
- **Data Exports**: Large exports (>10MB) return download URLs

## Implementation Insights & Learnings

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Advertiser/Account Pattern**: After consulting with ad tech protocol experts, we confirmed that brand agents should act as advertiser-level containers, which aligns with industry standards.

2. **Create/Update Pattern for Creative Assignment**: Instead of separate assignment tools, we follow the existing pattern where creatives are assigned during campaign creation or via updates. This maintains API consistency.

3. **Stub Architecture**: Advanced features (standards, audiences, measurement) are implemented as extensible stubs. This provides immediate usability while allowing for detailed implementation later.

4. **Resource Ownership Model**: Clear hierarchy where brand agents own all resources, but campaigns reference shared assets like creatives and audiences.

5. **Flat vs Hierarchical URLs**: After protocol review, we chose a hybrid approach - brand agents are contexts for creation, but resources remain accessible via flat IDs for flexibility.

### Technical Learnings

**TypeScript Configuration**: The project initially used `@tsconfig/node22` which wasn't available. We replaced it with a custom configuration targeting ES2020 with proper Node.js types.

**ESLint Rules**: Strict rules against `any` types required using `Record<string, unknown>` for flexible object types. Unused variables in destructuring assignments need explicit ignoring with `[, value]`.

**MCP Tool Patterns**: Consistent patterns across all tools:

- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Auth checking with fallback to environment variables
- Human-readable response formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear annotations and descriptions

**GraphQL Query Organization**: Separating brand agent queries into their own file maintains clean code organization while extending the existing client architecture.

### Development Best Practices Discovered

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Building core functionality first (CRUD operations) then adding specialized features allows for better testing and validation.

2. **Type-First Development**: Defining comprehensive TypeScript interfaces before implementation prevents structural issues and ensures consistency.

3. **Tool Naming Consistency**: Following the pattern `verb_noun` (e.g., `create_brand_agent`, `list_campaigns`) makes tools intuitive for conversational AI.

4. **Human-Readable Responses**: Rich text responses with emojis, formatting, and actionable insights significantly improve user experience.

5. **Stub Pattern**: Implementing stubs with clear documentation about future expansion provides immediate value while maintaining development flexibility.

### Architecture Benefits Realized

- **Clean Separation**: Brand agent ownership model eliminates ambiguity about resource relationships
- **Natural Workflows**: The advertiser → campaign → creative flow mirrors real advertising workflows
- **Extensibility**: Stub implementations provide clear paths for feature expansion
- **Tool Consistency**: All 20+ tools follow identical patterns for parameter handling, auth, and responses
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience

## Documentation Development

The project includes comprehensive Mintlify documentation with integrated validation:

### Local Development

```bash
npm run docs:dev  # Start local documentation server
```

### Validation Commands

**Prerequisites**: Requires Mintlify CLI: `npm install -g mintlify`

```bash
npm run docs:validate:openapi  # Validate OpenAPI spec (requires Mintlify CLI)
npm run docs:validate:links    # Check for broken links (informational)
npm run docs:validate          # Run full validation
```

The documentation validation is available as:

- **Optional local validation**: Requires Mintlify CLI to be installed globally
- **Separate from CI**: Documentation validation doesn't block main CI pipeline
- **Development workflow**: Easy local validation when Mintlify CLI is available
- **OpenAPI consistency**: Ensures documentation stays in sync with API spec
