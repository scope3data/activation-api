# Scope3 Campaign API MCP Server

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides comprehensive tools for managing advertising campaigns, brand agents, creatives, and targeting through the Scope3 API. The server follows an advertiser/account-based architecture where brand agents act as top-level containers that own campaigns, creatives, audiences, standards, and measurement sources.

## Architecture Overview

The API uses a hierarchical **Brand Agent** model that mirrors traditional ad tech advertiser/account structures:

```
BrandAgent (Advertiser/Account)
  ├── Campaigns (multiple, owned by brand agent)
  ├── Creatives (multiple, shared across campaigns)
  ├── Standards (brand safety configuration)
  ├── SyntheticAudiences (multiple, shared across campaigns)
  └── MeasurementSources (tracking integrations)
```

### Key Design Principles

- **Advertiser-Centric**: Brand agents act as advertiser accounts that own all resources
- **Resource Sharing**: Creatives and audiences can be reused across campaigns within the same brand agent
- **Create/Update Pattern**: Creative assignment follows consistent patterns (no separate assignment tools)
- **Stub Architecture**: Advanced features (standards, audiences, measurement) implemented as extensible stubs
- **Natural Language**: All tools work conversationally with Claude

### Setting up a Brand Agent

```
1. User: "Create a brand agent called Nike"
   → create_brand_agent creates ba_123

2. User: "Set brand safety rules to block competitor sites"
   → set_brand_standards configures domain blocklist

3. User: "Add a video creative for summer sale"
   → create_creative creates cr_456

4. User: "Create tech enthusiasts audience"
   → create_audience creates aud_789

5. User: "Create $50K campaign targeting tech users with summer creative"
   → create_campaign with brandAgentId=ba_123, creativeIds=[cr_456], audienceIds=[aud_789]
```

### Managing Campaigns

```
1. User: "List all campaigns for Nike brand agent"
   → list_campaigns shows campaign status and assignments

2. User: "Update campaign to use different creatives"
   → update_campaign with new creativeIds (replaces existing)

3. User: "Show me all creatives available for Nike"
   → list_creatives shows all brand agent assets
```

## Authentication

All tools (except check_auth) require a Scope3 API key. Provide authentication via HTTP headers only:

- `x-scope3-api-key` header
- `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` header

**Note**: API keys are never stored server-side and must be provided by the client in each request.

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

This MCP server runs in HTTP mode only. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3001/mcp`.

**Health Check**: Built-in health endpoint at `/health`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Returns "ok"
```

**Authentication**: Include your Scope3 API key in requests:

```bash
curl -H "x-scope3-api-key: your_api_key" http://localhost:3001/mcp
```

### HTTP Mode

The server runs in HTTP mode by default:

```bash
npm start  # Starts on port 3001
```

Or specify a custom port:

```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

## Features

- **Encapsulated Workflows**: Single tool calls handle complex multi-step processes
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert campaign descriptions into technical targeting profiles
- **INTELLIGENT_PMPS Strategy**: Uses Scope3's intelligent programmatic private marketplace strategy
- **Human-Readable Responses**: Returns text summaries instead of raw technical data
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages for authentication and API issues

## Implementation Insights & Learnings

### Design Decisions Made

1. **Advertiser/Account Pattern**: After consulting with ad tech protocol experts, we confirmed that brand agents should act as advertiser-level containers, which aligns with industry standards.

2. **Create/Update Pattern for Creative Assignment**: Instead of separate assignment tools, we follow the existing pattern where creatives are assigned during campaign creation or via updates. This maintains API consistency.

3. **Stub Architecture**: Advanced features (standards, audiences, measurement) are implemented as extensible stubs. This provides immediate usability while allowing for detailed implementation later.

4. **Resource Ownership Model**: Clear hierarchy where brand agents own all resources, but campaigns reference shared assets like creatives and audiences.

5. **Flat vs Hierarchical URLs**: After protocol review, we chose a hybrid approach - brand agents are contexts for creation, but resources remain accessible via flat IDs for flexibility.

### Technical Learnings

**TypeScript Configuration**: The project initially used `@tsconfig/node22` which wasn't available. We replaced it with a custom configuration targeting ES2020 with proper Node.js types.

**ESLint Rules**: Strict rules against `any` types required using `Record<string, unknown>` for flexible object types. Unused variables in destructuring assignments need explicit ignoring with `[, value]`.

**MCP Tool Patterns**: Consistent patterns across all tools:

- Zod schemas for parameter validation
- Auth checking with fallback to environment variables
- Human-readable response formatting
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear annotations and descriptions

**GraphQL Query Organization**: Separating brand agent queries into their own file maintains clean code organization while extending the existing client architecture.

### Development Best Practices Discovered

1. **Incremental Implementation**: Building core functionality first (CRUD operations) then adding specialized features allows for better testing and validation.

2. **Type-First Development**: Defining comprehensive TypeScript interfaces before implementation prevents structural issues and ensures consistency.

3. **Tool Naming Consistency**: Following the pattern `verb_noun` (e.g., `create_brand_agent`, `list_campaigns`) makes tools intuitive for conversational AI.

4. **Human-Readable Responses**: Rich text responses with emojis, formatting, and actionable insights significantly improve user experience.

5. **Stub Pattern**: Implementing stubs with clear documentation about future expansion provides immediate value while maintaining development flexibility.

### Architecture Benefits Realized

- **Clean Separation**: Brand agent ownership model eliminates ambiguity about resource relationships
- **Natural Workflows**: The advertiser → campaign → creative flow mirrors real advertising workflows
- **Extensibility**: Stub implementations provide clear paths for feature expansion
- **Tool Consistency**: All 20+ tools follow identical patterns for parameter handling, auth, and responses
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
