## Prerequisites

Before setting up your brand agent, ensure you have:

- **Scope3 API Key**: [Get your API key](https://app.scope3.com/api-keys)
- **Advertiser Domain List**: All domains your company owns
- **DSP Account Information**: If using private marketplaces
- **Team Access Requirements**: Who needs API access

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

For immediate testing and basic campaigns:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Basic Brand Agent">
    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.agentic.scope3.com/v1/brand-agents \
      -H "x-scope3-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "name": "Your Company Name",
        "description": "Primary brand agent for advertising campaigns"
      }'
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Note Your Brand Agent ID">
    Save the returned `brandAgentId` (e.g., `ba_abc123`) - you'll need it for all subsequent operations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test with a Campaign">
    You can now create campaigns, add creatives, and start advertising immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Quick Start Complete**: You now have a functional brand agent. Continue reading for production-ready configuration including domain verification, brand safety, and DSP integrations.
</Note>

## Production Setup

### 1. Advertiser Domain Configuration

**Why domains matter**: Domain verification establishes brand ownership and enables advanced features like brand safety monitoring and competitive exclusions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Primary Domains">
    Add all domains your company owns and operates:
    
    ```json
    {
      "advertiserDomains": [
        "yourcompany.com",
        "app.yourcompany.com", 
        "shop.yourcompany.com",
        "support.yourcompany.com"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    **Include**:
    - Main company website
    - Product/service subdomains
    - E-commerce platforms
    - Support and documentation sites
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Brand Family">
    For companies with multiple brands:
    
    ```json
    {
      "advertiserDomains": [
        "parentcompany.com",
        "brand1.com",
        "brand2.com",
        "brand1-shop.com",
        "brand2-mobile.com"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    **Strategy**: Include all brands under the same brand agent if they share marketing budgets and creative assets.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="International">
    For global companies with country-specific domains:
    
    ```json
    {
      "advertiserDomains": [
        "company.com",
        "company.co.uk",
        "company.de",
        "company.fr",
        "company.com.au"
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    **Benefit**: Enables region-specific brand safety and competitive analysis.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Brand Standards Configuration

Protect your brand with comprehensive safety rules:

```javascript
const brandStandards = {
  domainBlocklist: [
    // Direct competitors
    "competitor1.com",
    "competitor2.com",
    
    // Industry competitors  
    "competing-product.com",
    "rival-service.com",
    
    // Sensitive categories
    "political-site.com",
    "adult-content.com"
  ],
  
  contentCategories: {
    blocked: [
      "politics",
      "adult", 
      "violence",
      "gambling",
      "tobacco"
    ],
    preferred: [
      "technology",
      "sports", 
      "lifestyle",
      "business",
      "education"
    ]
  },
  
  keywordFilters: [
    // Competitor brand names
    "CompetitorBrand",
    "RivalProduct",
    
    // Sensitive topics
    "political candidate",
    "controversial topic",
    
    // Quality exclusions
    "free download",
    "click here now"
  ]
};
```

<Warning>
**Important**: Brand standards apply to ALL campaigns within the brand agent. Set these carefully as they cannot be overridden at the campaign level.
</Warning>

### 3. DSP Integration (For PMPs)

Private Marketplace (PMP) deals require DSP account integration:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The Trade Desk">
    ```json
    {
      "dspIntegrations": [
        {
          "platform": "ttd",
          "advertiserId": "your-ttd-advertiser-id",
          "partnerId": "your-ttd-partner-id",
          "configuration": {
            "preferredDealTiers": ["premium", "guaranteed"],

              "pmp": 0.3
            }

              "thirdParty": 0.6
            }
          }

    }
    ```
    
    **Amazon-Specific Features**:
    - Product catalog integration
    - Amazon Attribution setup
    - Inventory source preferences
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Team Access & API Keys

Configure team access with appropriate permissions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Team API Keys">
    Create separate API keys for different teams and systems:
    
    - **Campaign Managers**: Full campaign and creative access
    - **Analysts**: Read-only access to reporting data
    - **Systems Integration**: Programmatic access for automation
    - **Developers**: Sandbox/testing environment access
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set Permission Levels">
    ```json
    {
      "teamAccess": [
        {
          "role": "campaign_manager",
          "permissions": ["create_campaigns", "manage_creatives", "view_reports"],
          "brandAgentAccess": ["ba_your_brand_123"]
        },
        {
          "role": "analyst", 
          "permissions": ["view_reports", "export_data"],
          "brandAgentAccess": ["ba_your_brand_123"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Security Best Practices">
    - **Rotate Keys Quarterly**: Set calendar reminders for key rotation
    - **Environment Separation**: Different keys for prod/staging/dev
    - **Audit Access**: Regular review of who has access to what
    - **Secure Storage**: Use environment variables, never commit to code
  </Step>
</Steps>
