## Architecture Overview

The Scope3 Campaign API is built around a **Brand Agent** architecture that mirrors how programmatic advertising actually works in the industry.

<img src="/images/architecture-diagram.svg" alt="API Architecture" />

### Why Brand Agents?

Every major programmatic platform uses an account-based hierarchy:
- **Google Ads**: Advertiser Account â†’ Campaigns  
- **The Trade Desk**: Advertiser â†’ Campaigns
- **Facebook Business**: Ad Account â†’ Campaigns

Brand agents serve as your advertiser account, owning all marketing assets and campaigns.

## Core Concepts

### Brand Agent
Your advertiser account that owns all resources. Think of it as your marketing organization within Scope3.

```
Brand Agent: "Nike"
â”œâ”€â”€ Campaigns: Holiday Sale, Summer Launch, Back to School
â”œâ”€â”€ Creatives: Video ads, display banners, native content
â”œâ”€â”€ Audiences: Sports enthusiasts, runners, basketball fans  
â”œâ”€â”€ Brand Standards: Safety rules, blocked domains
â””â”€â”€ Measurement: Analytics integrations, conversion tracking
```

**When to create:** One per advertiser/brand. Most organizations have 1-3 brand agents.

### Campaigns  
Marketing initiatives with specific budgets, targeting, and optimization goals.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Campaign Properties">
    - **Budget**: Total spend and pacing rules
    - **Targeting**: Who to reach (via audiences and signals)
    - **Creative**: What content to show (via creative assets)
    - **Optimization**: How to improve performance (via tactics)
    - **Delivery**: Real-time spend and performance tracking
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Campaign States">
    - **Scheduled**: Created but not yet started
    - **Delivering**: Live and spending budget
    - **Paused**: Temporarily stopped
    - **Completed**: Ended (by budget or schedule)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Creatives
Your actual ad content - videos, images, text, or interactive media.

| Type | Use Case | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Video** | CTV, YouTube, social | 30-second brand spot |
| **Image** | Display, social, native | Product photography |
| **Native** | In-feed, content marketing | Article-style ads |
| **HTML5** | Interactive, rich media | Playable game ads |

**Reusability**: Creatives can be shared across multiple campaigns within the same brand agent.

### Tactics
Algorithm-driven optimization approaches that determine **how** your campaign buys inventory.

Each tactic combines:
- **Signals**: Data inputs for targeting (age, interests, behaviors)
- **Stories**: Narrative contexts that guide messaging
- **Optimization**: ML algorithms that improve performance

```
Example Tactic:
Signals: ["age_25_34", "interest_sports", "device_mobile"]
Stories: ["performance", "lifestyle"]  
â†’ Targets mobile sports fans 25-34 with performance/lifestyle messaging
```

### Signals & Stories

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Signals">
    **What they are**: Data points used for targeting and optimization
    
    **Examples**:
    - Demographics: `age_25_34`, `income_high`
    - Interests: `interest_sports`, `interest_travel`
    - Behaviors: `purchase_intent`, `brand_affinity`
    - Context: `device_mobile`, `weekend_viewing`
    
    **Usage**: Group by signals in reports to understand which audiences perform best
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stories">
    **What they are**: Narrative frameworks that guide creative messaging
    
    **Examples**:
    - `performance`: Focus on product benefits and features
    - `lifestyle`: Emphasize emotional connection and identity
    - `urgency`: Create time-sensitive purchase motivation  
    - `social_proof`: Highlight popularity and testimonials
    
    **Usage**: Group by stories to see which messaging themes resonate
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Data Model

### Resource Hierarchy

```
Brand Agent (ba_*)
â”œâ”€â”€ Campaigns (camp_*)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Delivery Summary (real-time performance)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Notification Thresholds (automated alerts)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Tactics (optimization components)
â”œâ”€â”€ Creatives (cr_*) - Shared across campaigns  
â”œâ”€â”€ Audiences (aud_*) - Shared across campaigns
â”œâ”€â”€ Brand Standards (domain blocks, safety rules)
â”œâ”€â”€ Measurement Sources (analytics integrations)
â””â”€â”€ Webhook Subscriptions (real-time notifications)
```

### ID Patterns

All resources follow consistent ID patterns:
- Brand Agents: `ba_abc123`
- Campaigns: `camp_xyz789` 
- Creatives: `cr_def456`
- Audiences: `aud_ghi789`
- Tactics: `tactic_jkl012`

## Reporting Architecture

### Dual-Mode Design

The API supports two distinct reporting approaches:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Casual Users">
    **Natural Language Summaries**
    - Rich text responses with insights
    - Health scores and recommendations  
    - ASCII charts and visualizations
    - Conversational interface via AI assistants
    
    ```
    User: "How's my campaign doing?"
    Response: "ðŸŽ¯ Health Score: 87/100 (Healthy)
              ðŸ“Š Spending on track, strong mobile performance..."
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Enterprise Systems">
    **Structured Data Exports**
    - JSON/CSV/Parquet formats
    - Flexible grouping and aggregation
    - BI system integration
    - Custom date ranges and filters
    
    ```json
    {
      "campaigns": [...],
      "groupBy": ["date", "tactic", "signal"],
      "metrics": {
        "spend": 12450.00,
        "impressions": 2100000,
        "efficiency": 0.87
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Event Model

All campaign interactions are captured as events with reinforcement learning rewards:

```typescript
interface CampaignEvent {
  eventType: string;      // "impression", "click", "purchase", "survey"
  reward: {
    immediate: number;    // 0.0 to 1.0 reward score
    delayed?: number;     // Future reward (LTV, brand lift)
    confidence?: number;  // ML confidence level
  };
}
```

This enables sophisticated attribution and optimization algorithms.

| **Creative File Size** | 50MB maximum | CDN delivery recommended |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Brand Agent Organization">
    - **One per brand/advertiser**: Don't create multiple brand agents for the same brand
    - **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that team members will understand
    - **Resource sharing**: Take advantage of shared creatives and audiences across campaigns
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Campaign Structure">
    - **Focused targeting**: Each campaign should have a clear audience and goal
    - **Sufficient budget**: $10,000+ enables meaningful ML optimization
    - **Creative variety**: Test multiple creative assets to find top performers
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Monitoring">
    - **Set up webhooks**: Get real-time alerts for important events
    - **Regular analysis**: Use tactic analysis tools to optimize signal/story performance  
    - **Data export**: Integrate with your BI systems for deeper analysis
  </Accordion>
