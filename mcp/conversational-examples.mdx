3. **Ask Why**: "Why is CPM high?" gets detailed analysis
4. **Combine**: "Create campaign + set alerts + export data"

### Common Flows

**Morning Review**:
"Yesterday's performance?" → "Any issues?" → "Top opportunities?"

**Weekly Planning**:
"This week's results?" → "Budget reallocation?" → "Export for meeting"

**Troubleshooting**:
"CPM increased, why?" → "Creative breakdown?" → "What optimizations?"
