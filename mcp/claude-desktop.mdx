## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Claude Desktop app installed
- Node.js 18+ 
- Scope3 API key

### Quick Setup

1. **Clone and install the MCP server**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd scope3-campaign-api
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Start the MCP server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # Server runs on http://localhost:3001/mcp
   ```

3. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   Add the following to your Claude Desktop MCP settings:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "scope3-campaigns": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["dist/index.js"],
         "cwd": "/path/to/scope3-campaign-api",
         "env": {
           "SCOPE3_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart Claude Desktop** to load the new MCP server.

## Authentication Setup

### Environment Variables

The simplest setup uses environment variables:

```bash
# .env file
SCOPE3_API_KEY=your_scope3_api_key_here
```

### Runtime Authentication

You can also provide your API key during conversations:

```
User: "Use API key sk-scope3-abc123 to create a brand agent for Nike"
Claude: I'll use that API key to create your brand agent...
```

<Warning>
Never share API keys in screenshots or public conversations. Claude forgets API keys between sessions for security.
</Warning>
