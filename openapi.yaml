    API for managing agentic advertising campaigns executed via AdCP using Scope3 media quality,
    synthetic audience, cross-publisher frequency capping, custom signals integration, and
    intelligent allocation.


    ## Key Concepts

    - **Brand Agent**: Your advertiser account - the top-level container for campaigns, creatives,
    and settings

    - **Campaign**: Individual budget allocation units created with natural language prompts  

    - **Creative**: Reusable ad assets shared across campaigns within a brand agent

    - **Synthetic Audience**: AI-enhanced targeting profiles built from natural language
    descriptions

    - **Brand Standards**: Brand safety and content filtering rules applied across all campaigns


    ## Platform Migration

    This API is designed to make migration from traditional DSPs seamless:


    ### The Trade Desk Users

    - **Advertiser** → Brand Agent

    - **Line Item** → Campaign  

    - **Creative** → Creative (shared across campaigns)

    - **Audience Segment** → Synthetic Audience


    ### DV360 Users  

    - **Advertiser** → Brand Agent

    - **Insertion Order** → Campaign

    - **Creative** → Creative (shared across campaigns)

    - **Audience List** → Synthetic Audience


    ## Natural Language Campaign Management

    Instead of configuring complex targeting parameters, describe your campaign goals in plain
    English:


    ```

    "Target young professionals interested in sustainable products in major cities with a $10K
    budget"

    ```


    The AI handles audience creation, bidding optimization, and performance management
    automatically.


    ## Getting Started

    1. Create a Brand Agent (your advertiser account)

    2. Upload Creative assets to the shared library

    3. Create Campaigns using natural language prompts

    4. Monitor AI-powered optimization and performance
