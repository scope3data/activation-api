# Scope3 Ad Platform

**The Ad Buying Platform for People & Agents**

üöÄ Start Simple, Scale Sophisticated

Welcome to Scope3 - where campaigns are conversations and complexity is optional.

## Quick Start: Your First Campaign

```javascript
// Step 1: Create your advertiser (brand agent)
const advertiser = await create_brand_agent({
  name: "Acme Corp",
  description: "Sustainable fashion brand"
});

// Step 2: Add a creative
const creative = await create_creative({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale Video",
  type: "video",
  url: "https://cdn.example.com/summer-sale.mp4"
});

// Step 3: Launch your campaign
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: advertiser.id,
  name: "Summer Sale 2024",
  prompt: "Reach eco-conscious millennials interested in sustainable fashion",
  budget: { 
    total: 50000,
    currency: "USD"
  },
  startDate: "2024-06-01",
  endDate: "2024-08-31",
  creativeIds: [creative.id]
});
```

**That's it. Our built-in optimization handles the rest.**

## Our Philosophy

### 1. People & Agents, Together

Your team and AI agents work side-by-side. Humans set strategy, agents execute tactics. Full transparency and control when you want it.

### 2. Allocation, Not Bidding

Unlike traditional DSPs with complex bidding algorithms, we focus on intelligent allocation - distributing your budget across the right inventory mix. Think portfolio management, not auction mechanics.

### 3. Works Alongside Your Stack

Run Scope3 in parallel with your existing platforms. Test new inventory sources, explore emerging channels, or optimize specific campaign types.

## Choose Your Optimization Approach

### üéØ Built-in Optimization
**Perfect for: Teams seeking efficiency and simplicity**

```javascript
// We optimize inventory allocation automatically
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Brand Awareness Q4",
  prompt: "Maximize reach for our new product launch",
  budget: { 
    total: 100000,
    currency: "USD"
  },
  startDate: "2024-10-01",
  endDate: "2024-12-31"
  // inventoryManagement defaults to scope3_managed
});
```

**What we handle:**
- Inventory mix optimization
- Signal selection
- Budget allocation across publishers
- Performance-based rebalancing

### üéõÔ∏è Granular Control
**Perfect for: Teams with specific strategies**

```javascript
// You control the inventory allocation
await create_campaign({
  brandAgentId: "ba_123",
  name: "Performance Campaign Q4",
  budget: { 
    total: 100000,
    currency: "USD"
  },
  inventoryManagement: {
    mode: "user_managed",
    optimizationGoal: "conversions"
  }
});

// Configure your inventory mix
await create_inventory_option({
  campaignId: "camp_123",
  name: "Premium CTV + 1P Data",
  mediaProductId: "hulu_premium_ctv",
  targeting: {
    signalType: "buyer"
  },
  budgetAllocation: { 
    amount: 40000,
    currency: "USD"
  }
});
```

## How We're Different

### Allocation vs. Bidding

Traditional DSPs focus on bid optimization - how much to pay for each impression. We focus on allocation optimization - where to spend your budget for maximum impact.

### Inventory as Building Blocks

Think of inventory options as building blocks for your campaign portfolio:

```javascript
// Build your campaign like a diversified portfolio
const portfolioApproach = [
  { name: "Premium CTV + Scope3 signals", allocation: "30%" },
  { name: "Programmatic display + 1P data", allocation: "40%" },
  { name: "Contextual targeting premium sites", allocation: "30%" }
];
```

## MCP: Built for AI Collaboration

### Natural Language, Real Actions

As an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, Scope3 is designed for AI agents to work directly with humans:

```
Human: "Find me premium video inventory under $40 CPM"
AI Agent: ‚Üí discover_publisher_products({ formats: ["video"], maxCpm: 40 })
```

**Human readable results:** AI agents get structured data, humans get clear insights.
