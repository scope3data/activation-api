## Step 6: Set Up Real-time Alerts (Optional)

Get notified instantly when your campaign needs attention:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dashboard Setup (Recommended)">
    1. **Log into [Scope3](https://app.scope3.com)**
    2. **Go to Campaign Settings** â†’ **Notifications**  
    3. **Choose where to send alerts:**
       - Slack channel
       - Email address
       - Custom webhook URL
       
    You'll get simple alerts like:
    ```
    ðŸš¨ Budget Alert: Nike Holiday Campaign
    ðŸ’° Daily spend: $3,247 (30% over limit)
    ðŸ”§ Action: Review budget or pause campaign
    ðŸ“Š View: https://app.scope3.com/campaigns/123
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Conversational">
    ```
    User: "How do I get notified when campaigns have problems?"
    Claude: The easiest way is through your Scope3 dashboard:
            
            1. Log into app.scope3.com
            2. Go to Campaign Settings â†’ Notifications
            3. Add your Slack channel or email
            
            You'll get alerts for budget overruns, performance drops,
            and campaign status changes. Much simpler than API setup!
