## Core Reporting Tools

### 📊 Campaign Summary & Insights

Get comprehensive campaign analysis with natural language explanations:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Real-time Insights
const summary = await getCampaignSummary({
  campaignId: "camp_airmax_123",
  includeCharts: true,
  verbosity: "detailed"
});

// Returns rich summary with health score, pacing, recommendations
console.log(summary.healthScore); // "82/100 (Healthy)"
console.log(summary.recommendations); // AI-powered optimization tips
```

```text Conversational
User: "How's my Nike campaign performing this week?"

Claude: 🎯 Nike Air Max Campaign Status:
        
Health Score: 82/100 (Healthy)
Spend: $18,247 of $75,000 budget  
Pacing: On track (52% budget, 48% through flight)
CTR: 1.24% (34% above benchmark)

💡 Key insight: age_25_34 + tech_interest performing 40% better
🔧 Recommendation: Increase budget allocation to top signals
```

</CodeGroup>

### 📈 Data Export for BI & Analytics

Export structured data for business intelligence tools:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Enterprise Export
const exportResult = await exportCampaignData({
  brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123",
  datasets: ["delivery", "events", "tactics"],
  groupBy: ["date", "campaign", "signal", "story"],
  dateRange: { start: "2024-01-01", end: "2024-01-31" },
  format: "parquet",
  compression: "gzip"
});

// Perfect for data warehouses, dashboards, ML pipelines
console.log(`${exportResult.totalRecords} records ready`);
```

```sql BigQuery Integration
-- Import exported data into BigQuery
LOAD DATA INTO campaign_performance
FROM FILES ('gs://your-bucket/scope3_export_*.parquet.gz')
WITH PARTITION COLUMNS;

-- Analyze signal performance
SELECT 
  signal,
  AVG(cpm) as avg_cpm,
  AVG(ctr) as avg_ctr,
  SUM(conversions) as total_conversions
FROM campaign_performance
GROUP BY signal
ORDER BY avg_ctr DESC;
```

</CodeGroup>

### 🎯 ML-Powered Tactic Analysis  

Deep performance analysis with statistical significance testing:

```javascript
const analysis = await analyzeTactics({
  campaignId: "camp_airmax_123",
  analysisType: "signals",
  compareSignals: true,
  timeframe: "30d"
});

// Statistical analysis with confidence intervals
analysis.signalEffectiveness.forEach(signal => {
  console.log(`${signal.signal}: ${signal.effectivenessScore} (p=${signal.pValue})`);
  if (signal.pValue < 0.05) {
    console.log(`✅ Statistically significant improvement`);
  }
});
```

## Quick Start Examples

### Morning Campaign Review

```
User: "Show me how all my campaigns performed yesterday"

Claude: 📊 Portfolio Performance (Yesterday):

🏃 Running Campaign: $347 spend, 28K impressions, $12.39 CPM ✅ Healthy
👟 Air Max Campaign: $2,180 spend, 156K impressions, $13.97 CPM ✅ Healthy  
👕 Lifestyle Campaign: $892 spend, 67K impressions, $13.31 CPM ⚠️ Warning

⚠️ Alert: Lifestyle campaign CTR dropped to 0.6% (below 0.8% threshold)
🔧 Action needed: Review creative performance or adjust targeting
```

### Weekly Performance Analysis

```javascript
// Export weekly data for team meeting
const weeklyReport = await exportCampaignData({
  brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123",
  dateRange: { start: "2024-01-08", end: "2024-01-14" },
  datasets: ["delivery", "events"],
  groupBy: ["date", "campaign", "creative"],
  format: "csv"
});

// Perfect for Excel analysis and presentations
console.log("Weekly report ready for download");
```

### Signal Optimization

```
User: "Which audience signals are working best across all campaigns?"

Claude: 🎯 Cross-Campaign Signal Analysis:

Top Performers (30 days):
1. age_25_34 + tech_interest: $11.24 CPM, 1.67% CTR ⭐️ Winner
2. lookalike_existing_customers: $13.89 CPM, 1.42% CTR, 3.12% conv rate
3. interest_premium_brands: $15.67 CPM, 1.23% CTR

🔧 Recommendation: Increase budget on winners by 40%
📊 Statistical confidence: 95% (all signals significantly different)
```

## Integration Patterns

### Real-time Dashboard

Monitor campaigns with live updates:

```javascript
// Get campaign insights for dashboard
async function updateDashboard() {
  const campaigns = await listCampaigns({ brandAgentId: "ba_nike_123" });
  
  for (const campaign of campaigns.campaigns) {
    const summary = await getCampaignSummary({ 
      campaignId: campaign.id,
      verbosity: "brief" 
    });
    
    updateCampaignWidget(campaign.id, {
      healthScore: summary.healthScore,
      spend: summary.todaySpend,
      impressions: summary.todayImpressions,
      alerts: summary.alerts
    });
  }
}
```

### Data Pipeline

Automated export for BI systems:

```python
# Daily ETL pipeline
def daily_campaign_export():
    yesterday = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    
    export_result = client.export_campaign_data(
        brand_agent_id="ba_nike_123",
        date_range={"start": yesterday, "end": yesterday},
        datasets=["delivery", "events", "tactics"],
        group_by=["date", "campaign", "signal", "story"],
        format="parquet"
    )
    
    # Load into data warehouse
    load_to_warehouse(export_result['downloadUrl'])
```
